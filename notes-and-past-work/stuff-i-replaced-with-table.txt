A majority of studies (`r country_nums["Europe"]` of `r num_studies`) were conducted in North America or Canada.  
`r english::Words(country_nums["Europe"])` studies were conducted in Europe, and the remaining `r english::words(country_nums["Asia, Australia, and worldwide"])` studies take place in Asia, Australia, or draw subjects from multiple countries.

`r english::Words(population_nums['University'])` studies sample from university students and staff, while `r population_nums['Adults']` look at an adult population. 
An additional `r english::words(population_nums['Young people'])` studies are aimed at adolescents, while `r english::words(population_nums['All ages'])` study people of all ages.

The most common delivery methods in our dataset were printed materials (`r english::words(delivery_nums['Printed_materials'])` studies), videos (`r english::words(delivery_nums['Video'])` studies), messages and/or manipulations in cafeterias and restaurants (`r delivery_nums['In_cafeteria']` studies), and the internet (online surveys, emails,  and text messages: `r delivery_nums['Online']` studies).

\begin{comment}
We could have a few additional sentences here: 2 studies use dietary consultations, 2 provide free access to free meat alternatives, and 1 is a university lecture; And about how some studies do a few things (some interventions combine two things (free legumes + dietary consultation), and some compare two interventions side by side (op ed vs video)), so the numbers don't add up. I think this is more complexity than a descriptive overview calls for, but if you want more texture, here's where we could provide it.
