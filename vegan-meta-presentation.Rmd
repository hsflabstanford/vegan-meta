## The paper in a nutshell

Meta-analysis of the most rigorous research

Main aim is to assess which theoretical approach produces the largest, most enduring behavioral changes

Overall null result ($\Delta$ = 0.02)

Individual studies [@jalil2023; @sparkman2020] are promising but no theoretical approach has a robust evidence base

Animal welfare arguments are especially ineffective

some big unknowns, e.g what people eat after an intervention ends or what the replace red meat with

## Talk outline:

### Methods and descriptive overview

### Survey of five major theoretical approaches

### Quantitative findings

### Next steps

## Paper aim: what makes this meta distinct

Assess the findings of the most rigorous studies, defined as

-   Randomized Controlled Trial

-   **Measures overall MAP consumption directly**

-   At least a single day after treatment starts

-   At least 25 subjects in treatment and control

-   **If cluster-assigned, at least 10 clusters**

Also, published in English by December 2023

## Descriptive overview

```{r load_data_and_constants, echo=F, include=F}
source('./scripts/libraries-functions-data.R')
source('./scripts/descriptive-stats.R')
source('./scripts/red-and-processed-meat.R')
```

`r num_papers` papers, `r num_studies` interventions, `r sum(dat$n_t_post + dat$n_c_post)` subjects

-   Supplementary dataset of `r num_RPMC_studies` studies aiming to reduce red and processed meat consumption (RPMC) w/ `r RPMC_subjects` subjects

The earliest paper is @allen2002, the latest is @jalil2023

A slight majority (`r third_decade_papers` of `r num_papers` papers) have been published since 2020

## Country breakdown:

| Country           | \# Interventions                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| United States     | `r country_dat["United States"]`  |
| Germany           | `r country_dat["Germany"]`        |
| Multiple (online) | 5                                 |
| United Kingdom    | `r country_dat["United Kingdom"]` |
| Netherlands       | `r country_dat["Netherlands"]`    |
| Sweden            | `r country_dat["Sweden"]`         |
| Australia         | `r country_dat["Australia"]`      |
| Canada            | `r country_dat["Canada"]`         |
| Denmark           | `r country_dat["Denmark"]`        |

## Settings & delivery mechanisms:

`r intervention_types_counts$leaflet_count` employed leaflets

`r intervention_types_counts$video_count` used videos

`r intervention_types_counts$cafeteria_or_restaurant` interventions in a cafeteria or restaurant

`r intervention_types_counts$internet_based` were administered online

`r pop_dat["university students"]` with university students

## Dependent Variables

`r self_report_count['Y']` of `r num_studies` interventions have self-reported outcomes, e.g.

-   diet journal asking participants how often they ate certain foods in the past seven days [@bochmann2017]
-   Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a structured recall task [@sparkman2021]
-   "During the three weeks of data collection, participants were asked to report their meat consumption on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays" [@alblas2023]

Objective outcomes tracked what participants ate [@jalil2023] or the proportion of meals that had MAP [@andersson2021]

## Five theoretical perspectives

The MAP reduction literature writ large is theoretically diverse and vast

but *these* studies all embody one or more of five theoretical perspectives:

-   nudges (choice architecture/behavioral economics)
-   norms
-   appeals to animal welfare
-   appeals to health
-   appeals to the environment

## Nudges

Nudges are everything that "shouldn’t influence behaviour, but in practice it does" [@hansen2016]

**Nudge**: A change in the size of your serving spoon [@vocski2024] or placing a vegetarian meal at the top of a cafeteria menu [@andersson2021]

**Not a nudge**: A change in price or a sign that says "people who eat meat are bad" (social opprobrium is an incentive)

## Example nudges

```{r example-nudges, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='49%', fig.cap=("images from Voşki et al. 2024 and  Sparkman et al. 2020")}

knitr::include_graphics(c("./images/spoons.jpeg", "./images/nudge-norm-message.png"))
```

## The nudge literature is huge, and a mess

Probably the dominant approach in the literature as a whole, but only `r sum(str_detect(pattern = 'nudge', string = dat$theory))` met our inclusion criteria. The rest

-   only measure what people say they would eat from a hypothetical menu [@campbell2014]

    -   "The study design may also be critiqued for not providing actual food choices and thus lacking any real consequences for—or opportunities to learn from—a less-than-optimal choice"

-   are underpowered and/or lack random assignment, e.g. alternate treatment/control for 4 days in total [@weimer2022]

    -   These limitations might be imposed by restaurant/cafeteria partners

-   have serious threats to internal validity, e.g. differential screening procedures for treatment and control [@rees2018] or changes to treatment after assignment based on subjects' prior diets [@morren2021]

## Norms

These interventions try to change attitudes about people who eat/avoid MAP (both who and how many) or try to make MAP alternatives seem popular

-   "you may be interested in the findings of recent research that... people higher in Social Dominance consume greater amounts of meats, and less fruits and vegetables" [@allen2002]
-   "The garden fresh veggie burger is a tasty choice! In a taste test we did at the [name of cafe], 95% of people said that the veggie burger tasted good or very good!” [@piester2020]
-   "News from [Name of Restaurant]! We’ve noticed that customers are starting to eat less meat by choosing more meatless dishes" [@sparkman2020]

## Injunctive, Descriptive, Static and Dynamic Norms

Descriptive: "The results of last week show that the average meat consumption of Dutch residents was: 1.32 times per day...[I]t appears that your meat consumption is above average compared to the average Dutch resident" [@alblas2023]

Injunctive: adds "How you are doing:\emoji{disappointed-face}" [@alblas2023]

Static: "Some people limit how much meat they eat...3 in 10 people eat less meat than they otherwise would." [@sparkman2017]

Dynamic: "Some people are starting to limit how much meat they eat... in recent years, 3 in 10 people have changed their behavior and begun to eat less meat than they otherwise would" [@sparkman2017]

## Appeals to animal welfare:

## Appeals to the health

## Appeals to the environment

## Reflections on this theoretical framing

The lines between perspectives are tricky – is a norm a nudge if it's a cafeteria? Is a message saying that your peers think a veggie burger is tasty communicating a norm?

-   Others distinguish between "changes to the microenvironment" [@bianchi2018restructuring] and "changes to conscious determinants" [@bianchi2018conscious] but a lot of place-based changes are also aimed at conscious processes

Many studies embody multiple perspectives, e.g. @jalil2023; which is doing the work?

Ultimately, I like dividing between: try to change MAP availability/salience (nudge); try to change attitudes about people who eat/avoid MAP (norm); & try to change attitudes about MAP (persuasion)

## Results!

Overall null: $\Delta$ = 0.02

`r sum(dat$neg_null_pos == 0)` of `r num_studies` interventions are nulls in their own words

No evidence of publication bias (Caveat that If we analyzed all outcomes, or outcomes that authors present as primary, we might find more — a lot of studies present moderated results as primary outcome)

## This might come as a surprise...

Previous meta-analyses have found much larger effects

-   e.g. @mathur2021meta, which meta-analyzed "100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals" and found "meaningfully large effects (meta- analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95% CI: [1.13, 1.33])."

Many causes, but the biggest driver of divergence is probably our focus on MAP *consumption* vs. attitudes & intentions

-   For @mathur2021meta, of the ten "studies with the largest calibrated estimates," nine "assessed outcomes related to intended behavior" and the tenth wasn't an RCT

## A breakdown by theory

## Nudges: what we do and don't know

## Norms: what we do and don't know

## Appeals to animal welfare: what we do and don't know

## Appeals to the environment: what we do and don't know

## Appeals to health: what we do and don't know

## Where do we go from here?

## State of knowledge

## Theory building

## Future studies

## Policy recommendations

## Thank you!

## Why another meta (continued)

We already have nearly 40 previous systematic where MAP consumption is either independent or dependent variable

Most are focused on a particular strand of literature, e.g.:
