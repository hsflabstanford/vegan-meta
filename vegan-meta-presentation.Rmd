## The paper in a nutshell

Meta-analysis of the most rigorous research

Main aim is to assess which theoretical approach produces the largest, most enduring behavioral changes

Overall null result (‚àÜ = 0.02)

Individual studies [@jalil2023; @sparkman2020] are promising but no theoretical approach has a robust evidence base

Animal welfare arguments are especially ineffective

I worry about 'regression to the meat:' what people eat after an intervention ends or what they eat instead if we discourage red meat consumption

## Talk outline:

### Paper aims and methods

### Descriptive overview of papers

### Survey of five major theoretical approaches

### Quantitative findings

### Next steps

## Paper aim: why another meta?

We already have nearly 40 previous systematic where MAP consumption is either independent or dependent variable

Most are focused on a particular strand of literature, e.g.:

## Why another meta (continued)

The purpose of this paper is to assess the findings of the most rigorous studies, defined as

-   Randomized Controlled Trial

-   **Measures overall MAP consumption directly**

-   At least a single day after treatment starts

-   At least 25 subjects in treatment and control

-   **If cluster-assigned, at least 10 clusters**

Also, published in English by December 2023

## Studies that make the cut

```{r load_data_and_constants, echo=F, include=F}
source('./libraries-functions-data.R')
source('./descriptive-stats.R')
```

`r num_papers` papers, `r num_studies` interventions, `r sum(dat$n_t_post + dat$n_c_post)` subjects

The earliest paper is @allen2002, the latest is @jalil2023

A slight majority (`r third_decade_papers` of `r num_papers` papers) have been published since 2020

## Country breakdown:

| Country           | \# Interventions                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| United States     | `r country_dat["United States"]`  |
| Germany           | `r country_dat["Germany"]`        |
| Multiple (online) | 5                                 |
| United Kingdom    | `r country_dat["United Kingdom"]` |
| Netherlands       | `r country_dat["Netherlands"]`    |
| Sweden            | `r country_dat["Sweden"]`         |
| Australia         | `r country_dat["Australia"]`      |
| Canada            | `r country_dat["Canada"]`         |
| Denmark           | `r country_dat["Denmark"]`        |

## Settings & delivery mechanisms:

`r intervention_types_counts$leaflet_count` employed leaflets

`r intervention_types_counts$video_count` used videos

`r intervention_types_counts$cafeteria_or_restaurant` interventions in a cafeteria or restaurant

`r intervention_types_counts$internet_based` were administered online

`r pop_dat["university students"]` with university students

## Dependent Variables

`r self_report_count['Y']` of `r num_studies` interventions have self-reported outcomes, e.g.

-   diet journal asking participants how often they ate certain foods in the past seven days [@bochmann2017]
-   Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a structured recall task [@sparkman2021]
-   "During the three weeks of data collection, participants were asked to report their meat consumption on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays" [@alblas2023]

Objective outcomes tracked what participants ate [@jalil2023] or the proportion of meals that had MAP [@andersson2021]

## Five theoretical perspectives

The MAP reduction literature writ large is theoretically diverse and vast

but *these* studies all embody one or more of five theoretical perspectives:

-   nudges (choice architecture/behavioral economics)
-   norms
-   appeals to animal welfare
-   appeals to health
-   appeals to the environment

## Nudges

Nudges are everything that "shouldn‚Äôt influence behaviour, but in practice it does" [@hansen2016]

**Nudge**: A change in the size of your serving spoon [@vocski2024] or placing a vegetarian meal at the top of a cafeteria menu [@andersson2021]

**Not a nudge**: A change in price or a sign that says "people who eat meat are bad" (social opprobrium is an incentive)

## Example nudges

```
## The nudge literature is huge, and a mess

Probably the dominant approach in the literature as a whole, but only `r sum(str_detect(pattern = 'n udge', string = dat$theory))` met our inclusion criteria. The rest

-   only measure what people say they would eat from a hypothetical menu [@campbell2014]

    -   The study design may also be critiqued for not providing actual food choices and thus lacking any real consequences for‚Äîor opportunities to learn from‚Äîa less-than-optimal choice

-   are underpowered and/or lack random assignment, e.g. alternate treatment/control for 4 days in total [@weimer2022]

    -   These limitations might be imposed by restaurant/cafeteria partners

-   have serious threats to internal validity, e.g. differential screening procedures for treatment and control [@rees2018] or changes to treatment after assignment based on subjects' prior diets [@morren2021]

## Norms

These interventions try to change attitudes about people who eat/don't eat MAP (both who and how many people do it) or try to make MAP alternatives seem popular

-   "you may be interested in the findings of recent research that... people higher in Social Dominance consume greater amounts of meats, and less fruits and vegetables" [@allen2002]
-   "The garden fresh veggie burger is a tasty choice! In a taste test we did at the [name of cafe], 95% of people said that the veggie burger tasted good or very good! Consider giving the garden fresh veggie burger a try today!‚Äù [@piester2020]
-   "News from [Name of Restaurant]! We‚Äôve noticed that customers are starting to eat less meat by choosing more meatless dishes. We‚Äôre committed to offering a menu that gives you a variety of choices, all with fresh ingredients" [@sparkman2020]

## Injunctive, Descriptive, Static and Dynamic Norms

Descriptive: "The results of last week show that the average meat consumption of Dutch residents was: 1.32 times per day...Based on your answers, it appears that your meat consumption is average-average compared to the average Dutch resident" [@alblas2023]

Injunctive: adds "How you are doing: üòû" [@alblas2023]

Static: "Some people limit how much meat they eat...3 in 10 people eat less meat than they otherwise would." [@sparkman2017]

Dynamic: "Some people are starting to limit how much meat they eat... in recent years, 3 in 10 people have changed their behavior and begun to eat less meat than they otherwise would" [@sparkman2017]

## Appeals to animal welfare:

## Appeals to the health

## Appeals to the environment

## Reflections on this theoretical framing

The lines between perspectives are tricky ‚Äì is a norm a nudge if it's a cafeteria?

A lot of studies embody *multiple* perspectives, e.g. @jalil2023 presents information on both the health and the environment. Which is doing the work?

A different approach would be to separate "changes to the microenvironment" [@bianchi2018restructuring] and "changes to conscious determinants" [@bianchi2018conscious] but even this is imperfect: a lot of place-based changes are also messages

In the end I like the distinction between: try to change MAP availability/salience; try to change attitudes about people who eat or don't eat MAP; and try to change attitudes about MAP itself

But if you read the literature, you might find different divisions
