## The paper in a nutshell

Meta-analysis of the most rigorous research

Main aim is to assess which theoretical approach produces the largest, most enduring behavioral changes

Overall null result ($\Delta$ = 0.02)

Individual studies [@jalil2023; @sparkman2020] are promising but no theoretical approach has a robust evidence base

Animal welfare arguments are especially ineffective

some big unknowns, e.g what people eat after an intervention ends or what the replace red meat with

## Talk outline:

### Methods and descriptive overview

### Survey of five major theoretical approaches

### Quantitative findings

### Next steps

## Paper aim: what makes this meta distinct

Assess the findings of the most rigorous studies, defined as

-   Randomized Controlled Trial

-   **Measures overall MAP consumption directly**

-   At least a single day after treatment starts

-   At least 25 subjects in treatment and control

-   **If cluster-assigned, at least 10 clusters**

Also, published in English by December 2023

## Dependent Variables

`r self_report_count['Y']` of `r num_studies` interventions have self-reported outcomes, e.g.

-   diet journal asking participants how often they ate certain foods in the past seven days [@bochmann2017]
-   Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a structured recall task [@sparkman2021]
-   "During the three weeks of data collection, participants were asked to report their meat consumption on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays" [@alblas2023]

Objective outcomes tracked what participants ate [@jalil2023] or the proportion of meals that had MAP [@andersson2021]

## Five theoretical perspectives

The MAP reduction literature writ large is theoretically diverse and vast

but *these* studies all embody one or more of five theoretical perspectives:

-   nudges (choice architecture/behavioral economics)
-   norms
-   appeals to animal welfare
-   appeals to health
-   appeals to the environment

## Nudges

Nudges are "any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behaviour in a predictable way, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives...easy and cheap to avoid" [@thaler2009, p. 6]

e.g. @vocski2024 and @andersson2021:

\end{column}
\end{columns}
```
## The nudge literature is huge, and a mess

Probably the dominant approach in the literature as a whole, but only `r num_rep(sum(str_detect(pattern = 'nudge', string = dat$theory)))` met our inclusion criteria. The rest

-   only measure what people say they would eat from a hypothetical menu [@campbell2014]

    -   "The study design may also be critiqued for not providing actual food choices and thus lacking any real consequences for—or opportunities to learn from \textemdash a less-than-optimal choice"

-   are underpowered and/or lack random assignment \note{, e.g. alternate treatment/control for 4 days in total [@weimer2022]}

    -   These limitations might be imposed by restaurant/cafeteria partners

-   have serious threats to internal validity \note{e.g. differential screening procedures for treatment and control [@rees2018] or changes to treatment after assignment based on subjects' prior diets [@morren2021]}

If I might speculate about causes...

## Norms

These interventions try to change attitudes about people who eat/avoid MAP (both who and how many) or try to make MAP alternatives seem popular

-   "you may be interested in the findings of recent research that... people higher in Social Dominance consume greater amounts of meats, and less fruits and vegetables" [@allen2002]
-   "The garden fresh veggie burger is a tasty choice! In a taste test we did at the [name of cafe], 95% of people said that the veggie burger tasted good or very good!” [@piester2020]
-   "News from [Name of Restaurant]! We’ve noticed that customers are starting to eat less meat by choosing more meatless dishes" [@sparkman2020]}

## Norms example

From @sparkman2020:

```{r norms_example, echo=F, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/norms.png')
```

## Injunctive, Descriptive, Static and Dynamic Norms

Descriptive: "The results of last week show that the average meat consumption of Dutch residents was: 1.32 times per day...[I]t appears that your meat consumption is above average compared to the average Dutch resident" [@alblas2023]

Injunctive: adds "How you are doing: \emoji{disappointed-face}" [@alblas2023]

Static: "Some people limit how much meat they eat...3 in 10 people eat less meat than they otherwise would." [@sparkman2017]

Dynamic: "Some people are starting to limit how much meat they eat... in recent years, 3 in 10 people have changed their behavior and begun to eat less meat than they otherwise would" [@sparkman2017]

## Appeals to animal welfare:

These argue that eating MAP is ethically bad, so you should either stop doing it or cut back significantly

Often delivered through leaflets [@hennessy2016], videos designed to be "emotional and provocative" [@sparkman2021], and documentaries [@mathur2021effectiveness]

Often featuring materials from animal welfare organizations e.g. Mercy For Animals [@cooney2016], Animal Equality [@bertolaso2015] and The Humane League [@peacock2017]

## Appeals to health

Typically argue for benefits like cardiovascular gains, weight loss, or cancer prevention

Many studies here are focused on red/processed meat (RPMC), e.g. @sorensen2005, an "integrated interventions focused on nutrition, physical activity, and occupational health and activities focused on individual risk factors" whose outcome was whether subjects had $\leq$ 3 servings of red meat per week

Some of these seem likely to have a social desirabilty bias problem, e.g. @berndsen2005: "It is well known that meat (particularly hamburgers and pork) can increase cholesterol levels, which in turn increases **the prevalence of** heart and vascular diseases...there have been several meat crises: BSE, foot and mouth disease, illegal hormones in beef, to give a few examples. **The consumption** of meat contaminated with BSE can cause neurological damage, which can even result in death."

-   Three weeks later, participants "indicate how many days a week they eat meat at dinner."

## Appeals to the environment

These are typically but not always aimed at climate change

Mny studies point out that some MAP is better than others, e.g. @piester2020

```{r piester_study, echo=F, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/leafs.png')
```

## The most persuasive intervention: health + environment for college students

@jalil2023 found that a “50 min talk about the role of meat consumption in global warming, along with information about the health benefits of reduced meat consumption” led to a reduction in "meat consumption by 5.6 percentage points with no signs of reversal over 3 years”

-   The really remarkable thing about this study is that it has three years of data from dining halls

Two outstanding questions about this study:

-   what is doing the work, the global warming appeals or the health appeals?

-   If we replicate this study at different schools, will we see similar effects?

## Reflections on the theoretical framing

The lines between perspectives are tricky – is a norm a nudge if it's a cafeteria? Is a message saying that your peers think a veggie burger is tasty communicating a norm?

-   Other researchers distinguish between "changes to the microenvironment" [@bianchi2018restructuring] and "changes to conscious determinants" [@bianchi2018conscious] but a lot of place-based changes are also aimed at conscious processes

Ultimately, I like dividing between: try to change MAP availability/salience (nudge); try to change attitudes about people who eat/avoid MAP (norm); & try to change attitudes about MAP (persuasion)

## Results: how to think about them

Meta-analysis step one: convert each study's effects into a measure of standardized mean difference (SMD) \textemdash ($\Delta = \frac{M_1-M_2}{SD_C}$) \textemdash and its associated variance and standard error

Step two average those SMDs by a procedure that gives more weight to studies with lower variance, i.e. those with larger sample sizes

By convention, $\Delta$ = 0.2 is a small effect size; 0.5 is medium; and 1.0 is large

## How to think about different values of $\Delta$

@jalil2023: net reduction of 5.6% points; for the control group at pre-intervention, 65.5% of meals had meat with an SD of 47.5%.

$\Delta = \frac{.056}{0.457} = 0.118$

\note{This is considered a 'small' effect size, but it lasts for three years, so I give it a lot of credence}

@feltz2022, study 1: subjects who read a pamphlet ("Compassionate Choices") increase \# times they ate meat and/or eggs/day by `r 11.63-9.61` , vs `r 9.38-8.88` more for control subjects (SD = 5.87).

$\Delta =\frac{(11.63-9.61) - (9.38-8.88)}{5.87} = .259$

\note{negative because that's a backlash}

## Overall findings

Overall null: $\Delta$ = 0.0204

`r sum(dat$neg_null_pos == 0)` of `r num_studies` interventions are nulls in their own words

No evidence of publication bias (which makes sense given how many nulls we found)

\note{Caveat that if we analyzed all outcomes, or outcomes that authors present as primary, we might find more -- a lot of studies present moderated results as primary outcome}

## This might come as a surprise...

Previous meta-analyses have found much larger effects

-   e.g. @mathur2021meta, which found "meaningfully large effects (meta- analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95% CI: [1.13, 1.33])." \note{meta-analyzed "100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals"}

Many causes, but the biggest driver of divergence is probably our focus on MAP *consumption* vs. attitudes & intentions

-   For @mathur2021meta, of the ten "studies with the largest calibrated estimates," nine "assessed outcomes related to intended behavior" and the tenth wasn't an RCT

## Why another meta (continued)

We already have nearly 40 previous systematic where MAP consumption is either independent or dependent variable

Most are focused on a particular strand of literature, e.g.:
