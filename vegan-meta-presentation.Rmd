## The paper in a nutshell

-   Meta-analysis of the most rigorous research

-   Aim is to characterize the literature's main theoretical approaches and see which produces the largest, most enduring behavioral changes

-   Very tiny effects on MAP overall but larger effects on red and/or processed meat (RPMC)

-   Current status: final data checks and writing the manuscript

## How do we define 'rigorous research?'

We look at

-   Randomized Controlled Trials

-   **Measure overall MAP consumption directly**

    -   At least a single day after treatment starts

-   At least 25 subjects in treatment and control

    -   **If cluster-assigned, at least 10 clusters**

Also, published in English by December 2023

## Descriptive overview

`r num_papers` papers, `r num_studies` interventions, `r sum(dat$n_t_post + dat$n_c_post)` subjects

-   Supplementary dataset of `r num_RPMC_studies` studies aiming to reduce red and processed meat consumption (RPMC) w/ `r RPMC_subjects` subjects

The earliest paper is @allen2002, the latest is @jalil2023

A slight majority (`r third_decade_papers` of `r num_papers` papers) have been published since 2020

We disqualified about 400 studies and counting, and Jacob Peacock is working on a parallel review quantifying the literature as a whole

```
## Dependent Variables (Outcomes)

`r self_report_count['Y']` of `r num_studies` interventions have self-reported outcomes, e.g.

-   Diet journal asking participants how often they ate certain foods in the past seven days [@bochmann2017]
-   Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a structured recall task [@sparkman2021]
-   "During the three weeks of data collection, participants were asked to report their meat consumption on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays" [@alblas2023]

Objective outcomes either track subjects' behavior [@jalil2023] or sales data at a cafeteria/resaurant [@andersson2021]

## Three theoretical perspectives

The MAP reduction literature is theoretically diverse and vast

But *these* studies all embody one or more of three theoretical perspectives:

-   nudges (choice architecture/behavioral economics)
-   norms
-   Persuasion approaches, which come in three varieties:
    -   appeals to animal welfare
    -   appeals to health
    -   appeals to the environment

## Nudges

Nudges are "any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behaviour in a predictable way, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives...easy and cheap to avoid" [@thaler2009, p. 6]

e.g. @vocski2024 and @andersson2021:

\end{column}
\end{columns}
```
## The nudge literature is huge, and a mess

Probably the dominant approach in the literature as a whole, but only two met our inclusion criteria. The rest

-   only measure what people say they would eat from a hypothetical menu

    -   "The study design may also be critiqued for not providing actual food choices and thus lacking any real consequences for—or opportunities to learn from \textemdash a less-than-optimal choice" [@campbell2014]

-   are underpowered and/or lack random assignment \note{, e.g. alternate treatment/control for 4 days in total [@weimer2022]}

    -   These limitations might be imposed by restaurant/cafeteria partners

-   have serious threats to internal validity

    -   e.g. differential screening procedures for treatment and control [@rees2018] or changes to treatment after assignment based on subjects' prior diets [@morren2021]

If I might speculate about causes...

## Norms

These interventions try to change attitudes about people who eat/avoid MAP (both who and how many) or try to make MAP alternatives seem popular

-   "you may be interested in the findings of recent research that... people higher in Social Dominance consume greater amounts of meats, and less fruits and vegetables" [@allen2002]
-   "The garden fresh veggie burger is a tasty choice! In a taste test we did at the [name of cafe], 95% of people said that the veggie burger tasted good or very good!” [@piester2020]
-   "News from [Name of Restaurant]! We’ve noticed that customers are starting to eat less meat by choosing more meatless dishes" [@sparkman2020]

## Norms example

From @sparkman2020:

```{r norms_example, echo=F, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/norms.png')
```

## Injunctive, Descriptive, Static and Dynamic Norms

Descriptive: "The results of last week show that the average meat consumption of Dutch residents was: 1.32 times per day...[I]t appears that your meat consumption is above average compared to the average Dutch resident" [@alblas2023]

Injunctive: adds "How you are doing: \emoji{disappointed-face}" [@alblas2023]

Static: "Some people limit how much meat they eat...3 in 10 people eat less meat than they otherwise would." [@sparkman2017]

Dynamic: "Some people are starting to limit how much meat they eat... in recent years, 3 in 10 people have changed their behavior and begun to eat less meat than they otherwise would" [@sparkman2017]

## Persuasion: appeals to animal welfare:

These argue that eating MAP is ethically bad, and you should either stop or cut back significantly

Often delivered through leaflets [@hennessy2016], videos designed to be "emotional and provocative" [@sparkman2021], and documentaries [@mathur2021effectiveness]

Often featuring materials from animal welfare organizations e.g. Mercy For Animals [@cooney2016], Animal Equality [@bertolaso2015] and The Humane League [@peacock2017]

## Persuasion: appeals to health

Typically argue for benefits like cardiovascular gains, weight loss, or cancer prevention

Many strong studies here did not meet our inclusion criteria b/c they're focused on red/processed meat (RPMC)

-   @sorensen2005, an "integrated interventions focused on nutrition, physical activity, and occupational health and activities focused on individual risk factors" whose outcome was whether subjects had $\leq$ 3 servings of red meat per week (self-reported)

## Social desirability bias

@berndsen2005:

> It is well known that meat (particularly hamburgers and pork) can increase cholesterol levels, which in turn increases **the prevalence of** heart and vascular diseases...there have been several meat crises: BSE, foot and mouth disease, illegal hormones in beef, to give a few examples. **The consumption** of meat contaminated with BSE can cause neurological damage, which can even result in death

Then they ask people, three weeks later, how many days in a week they eat meat at dinner

## Persuasion: appeals to the environment

These are typically but not always aimed at climate change

Many studies point out that some MAP is better than others, e.g. @piester2020

```{r piester_study, echo=F, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/leafs.png')
```

## Quantitative findings: how to do a meta-analysis

Meta-analysis is a two-step process:

-   Convert each study's effects into a measure of standardized mean difference (SMD) \textemdash $\Delta = \frac{M_1-M_2}{SD_C}$ \textemdash and its associated variance & standard error

-   Average those SMDs and give more weight to more precise studies, i.e. those with larger samples

## Quantitative findings: how to think about effect sizes

@jalil2023: net reduction of 5.6% points; for the control group at pre-intervention, 65.5% of meals had meat with an SD of 47.5%.

$\Delta = \frac{.056}{0.457} = 0.118$

\note{ADD SPACE This is considered a 'small' effect size, but it lasts for three years, so I give it a lot of credence}

@feltz2022, study 1: subjects who read a pamphlet ("Compassionate Choices") increase \# times they ate meat and/or eggs/day by `r 11.63-9.61`, vs `r 9.38-8.88` more for control subjects (SD = 5.87).

$\Delta =\frac{(9.61- 11.63) - (8.88 -9.38)}{5.87} = -0.259$

\note{negative because that's a backlash}

## Quantitative results

\note{For each study, we calculate $\Delta$ and standard error and then combine them into a single overall estimate}

Overall estimate: $\Delta$ = 0.0204 (SE = .0121), p = 0.0931

-   Not statistically or clinically significant

`r sum(dat$neg_null_pos == 0)` of `r num_studies` interventions are nulls in their own words

No evidence of publication bias (which makes sense given how many nulls we found)

\note{Caveat that if we analyzed all outcomes, or outcomes that authors present as primary, we might find more -- a lot of studies present moderated results as primary outcome}

## This might come as a surprise...

Previous meta-analyses have found much larger effects

-   e.g. @mathur2021meta, which found "meaningfully large effects (meta- analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95% CI: [1.13, 1.33])." \note{meta-analyzed "100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals"}

Many causes, but the biggest driver of divergence is probably our focus on MAP *consumption* vs. attitudes & intentions

-   For @mathur2021meta, of the ten studies with the "largest calibrated estimates," nine "assessed outcomes related to intended behavior" and the tenth wasn't an RCT

## A larger effect on red and processed meat consumption (RPMC)

Overall effect on RPMC is `r RPMC_model$Delta` (SE = `r RPMC_model$se`), p `r RPMC_model$pval`

Still a small effect size, but from the perspective of health and the environment, this is good news

But from the perspective of animal welfare...we don't know [@mathur2022ethical]

## Where do we go from here?

@guzzo1987 argue that literature reviews serve four purposes:

-   Assessing the current state of knowledge
-   Theory-building
-   Directions for future research
-   Policy Implications

## State of knowledge

Speciesism is the core unsolved problem for radical change — but we already knew that

Lack of data on potential substitution, either between MAP products or over time ('regression to the meat'), is a consistent challenge

Upside: if you get this stuff right in *your* study, like @jalil2023 and @vocski2024 did, then you are advancing the state of knowledge substantially

Methods note: for a power calculation, your MDE should be tiny

## Looking closely at two promising studies: Jalil et al. (2023)

@jalil2023 found that a “50 min talk about the role of meat consumption in global warming, along with information about the health benefits of reduced meat consumption” led to a reduction in "meat consumption by 5.6 percentage points with no signs of reversal over 3 years”

-   That's *three years of objective data* from dining halls!

Two outstanding questions about this study:

-   Theoretical attribution: what portion of the content is having effects?

-   If we replicate this study at Kenyon & Kansas State, will we see similar effects in both places?

## Looking closely at Sparkman et al. (2020)

Four dynamic norms interventions around the Stanford area

**Study one**: message saying "Our meatless burgers are on the rise" at a campus sports cafe increased sale of vegetarian item from "1.4 to 1.7 percentage points," a "modest" impact

**Study two**: A message saying "We've noticed our customers are starting to eat less meat by choosing more meatless dishes" at a virtual restaurant that "*abruptly closed after 10 days of the intervention*" led to a "non-significant increase, estimated at 2.6 percentage points"

## Sparkman et al. (2020) continued

**Study three**: message saying "We’ve noticed that our customers are starting to order our meatless dishes for lunch more often" at a sit-down restaurant during lunch increased sales of vegetarian meals by 2.2% (significant)

**Study four**: the same setup as study three, except at dinner, and it *decreased* vegetarian sales by 3.7%

So do norms work but only sometimes? Was study four a fluke? Is the true ATE a null?

## Theory building

Connect your approach to its appropriate outcome

-   Appeals to animal welfare militate towards elimination rather than reduction

-   Appeals to health & environment militate towards cutting back, specifically on RPMC, but not necessarily towards something stricter

How do your subjects think about their own MAP consumption?

-   If each meal is chosen in isolation then, nudging behavior without targeting attitudes should cause reduction in consumption

-   If people have a weekly "meat budget," then expect regression to the meat

If you produce marginal changes, then I want to hear your plans for scaling up cheaply

## Future studies

We're at the advent of a new subfield! If you get the design and measurement details right, you can break new ground

Many compelling theories that haven't yet been rigorously tested, e.g. contact with farm animals or manipulations of price

Many institutionalized settings are waiting to be analyzed, e.g. retirement homes or basic training for the military

## Two concrete future study ideas

1.  Watch the movie 'Babe', or repeat the @jalil2023 lecture, and have follow-up discussion, at retirement homes
    -   Rich array of qualitative data from staff, e.g. "Daisy usually finishes her chicken but lately she hasn't"
2.  Give a lecture at West Point/Ranger School/wherever about the diets of Sherpas and Kenyan distance runners to dispel the idea that we need large quantities of animal protein to be awesome endurance athletes
    -   Challenge here is to make sure equivalent things (lentil soup, ugali) are made available

## Two more concrete future study ideas

3.  Work with Impossible/Beyond/Whole Foods/etc. to price meat substitutes a as \<, \>, and = to meat equivalent
    -   Can also randomize within treatments to bring price to people's attention
4.  Incorporate visit to farm sanctuary in incoming first-year's orientation -- the contact hypothesis [@allport1954] but interspecies
    -   With or without follow-up discussion about the experience

## Policy recommendations

Nudges and norms are promising, so let's figure out the scope conditions where they work

-   I hope it's not just college campuses

Environmental and health appeals are probably best suited to reducing RPMC

Animal advocacy materials need a rethink, and don't bother with pamphlets \emoji{disappointed-face}

## Thank you!

### Questions?

## Appendix slides: why another meta

We already have nearly 40 previous systematic where MAP consumption is either independent or dependent variable

Most are focused on a particular strand of literature, e.g.:

\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/meta-four.png}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
```
## Reflections on the theoretical framing

The lines between perspectives are tricky – is a norm a nudge if it's a cafeteria? Is a message saying that your peers think a veggie burger is tasty communicating a norm?

-   Other researchers distinguish between "changes to the microenvironment" [@bianchi2018restructuring] and "changes to conscious determinants" [@bianchi2018conscious] but a lot of place-based changes are also aimed at conscious processes

Ultimately, I like dividing between: try to change MAP availability/salience (nudge); try to change attitudes about people who eat/avoid MAP (norm); & try to change attitudes about MAP (persuasion)
