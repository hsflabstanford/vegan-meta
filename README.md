# Meaningfully reducing consumption of meat and animal products is an unsolved problem: results from a meta-analysis

A very initial draft is available on the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/k9qqGZtmWz3x4yaaA/environmental-and-health-appeals-are-the-most-effective); first draft of code and data are [available on Code Ocean](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.6020578.v1).


## paper   
  * `./manuscript/MAP-reduction-meta.Rmd` is the in-progress paper, along with its `.bib` file and style file, etc. 

## code
  * `./scripts/*.R` is where most of the actual R code lives.
  * `./functions/*.R` are some functions we wrote, mostly adapted/lifted from a previous project, [PaluckMetaSOP](https://github.com/setgree/PaluckMetaSOP).

## data
  * `./data/vegan-meta.csv`  is our dataset of studies
  * `./data/RPMC-data.csv` is a supplementary dataset of studies aimed at reducing consumption of red and processed meat
  * `./data/excluded-studies.csv` is our list of studies we looked at but didn't include & why
  * `./data/review-of-reviews.csv` is a list of prior reviews we looked at to find studies
