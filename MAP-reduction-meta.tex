\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Consumption of meat and animal products (MAP) is increasingly recognized
as a major contributor to premature deaths
\citep{willett2019, landry2023}, public health risks
\citep{slingenbergh2004, graham2008}, ecological harms
\citep{greger2010} and climate change
\citep{scarborough2023, koneswaran2008} as well as an ethical crisis in
its own right \citep{kuruc2023, singer2023}.

Supply-side interventions, such as banning or taxing certain practices
or products, risk political backlash if they do not broad public
support. It is of vital importance, therefore, to assess which
strategies and theoretical perspectives lead to the largest and most
durable reductions in demand for MAP products, under which conditions,
and for which populations. We address these questions with a
meta-analysis of the most rigorous studies aimed at reducing MAP
consumption.

The research on diet and its personal, cultural, and practical
antecedents on the one hand and its consequences for health, the
environment, and animal welfare on the other is vast. By our count,
there have been at least 120 previous reviews on these questions in the
past two decades, with at least thirty-seven focused specifically on MAP
reduction. However, two prior investigations revealed three common gaps
in the MAP literature: a dearth of long-term follow-ups, consumption
outcomes, and inattention to the gap between intentions and behavior
\citep{mathur2021meta, mathur2021effectiveness}. Our paper addresses
these concerns by meta-analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
that

\begin{itemize}
\item
  were designed to reduce MAP consumption, rather than (e.g.)
  encouraging substitution from red to white meat or fish
\item
  had least 25 subjects each in treatment and control, or, for
  cluster-randomized trials, at least 10 clusters in total;
\item
  measured MAP consumption, whether self-reported or observed directly,
  rather than (or in addition to) attitudes, intentions, beliefs or
  hypothetical choices;
\item
  recorded outcomes at least a single day after the start of treatment.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, studies needed to be publicly circulated by December 2023
and published in English.

In total we coded 33 papers
\citep{abrahamse2007, alblas2023, aldoh2023, allen2002, andersson2021, acharya2004, berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, bianchi2022, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, carfora2023, coker2022, cooney2016, fehrenbach2015, feltz2022, griesoph2021, haile2021, hatami2018, hennessy2016, jalil2023, lacroix2020, mathur2021effectiveness, mattson2020, merrill2009, norris2014, peacock2017, piester2020, polanco2022, sparkman2017, sparkman2020, sparkman2021, weingarten2022}
comprising 39 separate studies, 107 interventions, and approximately
78000 subjects. (Some treatments were administered at the level of day
or cafeteria and did not record their number of human subjects.) The
earliest paper was published in 2002 \citep{allen2002}, and a majority
(19 of 33) have been published since 2020.

We also coded a supplementary dataset of 14 papers aimed at reducing
consumption of red and/or processed meat (RPM)
\citep{carfora2017correlational, carfora2017randomised, carfora2019, carfora2019informational, delichatsios2001, dijkstra2022, emmons2005cancer, emmons2005project, jaacks2014, james2015, lee2018, perino2022, schatzkin2000, sorensen2005},
comprising 14 studies, 19 interventions, and approximately 8000
subjects. This was to provide a comparison between studies that aimed to
reduce overall MAP consumption and those that aimed to reduce RPM and
measured only changes in those categories, i.e.~not recording potential
substitution to other MAP products \citep{mathur2022ethical}.

Last, we compiled a third dataset of 780 excluded studies, along with
their reason(s) for exclusion.

Studies in our database pursued one or more of three main theories of
change: nudges, norms, and persuasion. A handful of studies pursued
norms and persuasion combined Table 1 reports the distribution of
studies, interventions, and subjects (approximately) per approach.

\textbf{Nudge} studies manipulate features of an environment to
non-obtrusively guide people towards a desired choice
\citep{thaler2009}. Although nudges are frequently implemented in the
diet literature writ large
\citep{olafsson2024, cadario2020, szaszi2018}, only one study that
focused on MAP reduction met our inclusion criteria
\citep{andersson2021}. That study manipulated the salience of a
plant-based dish by placing it either at the top or bottom of a menu in
a university cafeteria in Sweden.

\textbf{Norm} studies manipulate perceptions of the popularity of
desired outcomes, e.g.~plant-based dishes \citep{sparkman2021} or using
re-usable mugs\citep{loschelder2019}. Norms might be descriptive (``33\%
of British people\ldots successfully engaged in one or
more\ldots behaviours to eat less meat'' \citep{aldoh2023}), injunctive
(e.g.~a message with a frowning face for subjects who eat more meat than
the average person in their country or a smiling face for those who eat
less \citep{alblas2023}), or dynamic, i.e.~they tell subjects that the
number of people engaging in a desired behavior is increasing over time
\citep{aldoh2023, coker2022, sparkman2017, sparkman2020, sparkman2021}.
With regards to MAP reduction, this is a comparatively young literature,
with the first paper appearing in 2017.

\textbf{Persuasion} studies, which formed the majority in our database,
appeal directly to people about eating less meat. Arguments are
typically centered around health \citep{lacroix2020}, the environment
\citep{carfora2023} \textemdash typically climate change \textemdash and
animal welfare \citep{haile2021}. Some are designed to be emotionally
activating, e.g.~presenting upsetting footage of factory farms
\citep{bertolaso2015}, while others present facts more dispassionately,
e.g.~about the relationship between diet and colorectal cancer
\citep{hatami2018}.

Many persuasion studies provide information in multiple categories at
once, e.g.~a video on animal welfare and health reasons to cut back
\citep{feltz2022} or a leaflet with information in all three categories
\citep{hennessy2016}. Table 2 displays the distribution of persuasion
studies within the three categories. (Note that because many studies
present more than one category of message, the number of studies and
interventions will sum to more than the total number of persuasion
studies and interventions.)

Finally, a handful of studies combines \textbf{norms and persuasion}
approaches
\citep{hennessy2016, carfora2023, lacroix2020, mattson2020, piester2020}.
These interventions typically suggest reasons to eat less meat side by
side with information about changing consumer habits in society.

\subsection{An overall small effect}\label{sec2.2}

Our overall meta-analytic effect size is \(\Delta\) = 0.0603 (SE =
0.0213), p = .0097. Figure 1 displays the distribution of effect sizes,
grouped by paper, with each individual point representing an
intervention. The overall effect size is plotted at the bottom.

\includegraphics{results/figures/forest_plot-1} - This section depends
on what model we choose - note the preponderance of nulls according to
the studies themselves - some weak evidence of publication bias (effect
size goes up as SE gets bigger)

\subsection{Red and Processed Meat is an easier
target}\label{red-and-processed-meat-is-an-easier-target}

On average, interventions aimed at reducing consumption of red and
processed meat are considerably more effective than MAP reduction
interventions are: \(\Delta\) = 0.2493 \text{(SE = 0.0707)}, p = .0045.
Each of these studies employs persuasion, and a majority (16/19) appeal
to personal health. Moreover, many of these interventions are aimed at
older people who have had serious health issues, e.g.~cancer survivors
\citep{lee2018, james2015}.

However, the effect of these interventions on MAP reduction
\emph{overall} is unknown because these studies do not report on
consumption of white meat and/or fish. Red meat is of special concern
for its environmental and health consequences \citep{grummon2023}, but
chicken is arguably worse for animals on a pound-for-pound basis
\citep{mathur2022}. For some plausible patterns of substitution, these
interventions are a net positive for personal health and the environment
but a net negative for animal welfare.

\subsection{Health appeals are generally moderately effective,
especially when aimed at older, sicker
people}\label{health-appeals-are-generally-moderately-effective-especially-when-aimed-at-older-sicker-people}

\subsection{Environmental appeals, especially those aimed at college
students, have moderate positive
effects}\label{environmental-appeals-especially-those-aimed-at-college-students-have-moderate-positive-effects}

\subsection{Animal welfare appeals are almost always
ineffective}\label{animal-welfare-appeals-are-almost-always-ineffective}
