\abstract{Which theoretical approach leads to the broadest and most
enduring reductions in consumptions of meat and animal products (MAP)?
We address these questions with a theoretical review and meta-analysis
of especially rigorous Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). We
meta-analyze 33 papers comprising 39 studies,107 interventions, and
approximately 90000 subjects. We find that these papers employ either a
nudge, norms, or persuasion approach to changing behavior (some papers
combine norms and persuasion). The pooled effect of these interventions
on MAP consumption outcomes is \(\Delta\) = 0.057, suggesting that we
face an unsolved problem. Reducing consumption of red and processed meat
is an easier target: \(\Delta\) = 0.249, but because of missing data on
potential substitution to other MAP, we can't say anything definitive
about the consequences of these interventions on animal welfare. We
further explore effect size heterogeneity by approach, population, and
study features. We conclude that while no theoretical approach provides
a proven remedy to MAP consumption, designs and measurement strategies
have generally been improving over time, and many promising
interventions await rigorous evaluation.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Consumption of meat and animal products (MAP) is increasingly recognized
as a major contributor to premature deaths
\citep{willett2019, landry2023}, public health risks
\citep{slingenbergh2004, graham2008}, ecological harms
\citep{greger2010} and climate change
\citep{scarborough2023, koneswaran2008} as well as an ethical crisis in
its own right \citep{kuruc2023, singer2023}.

Supply-side interventions, such as banning or taxing certain practices
or products, risk political backlash if they do not have broad public
support. It is of vital importance, therefore, to assess which
strategies and theoretical perspectives lead to consistent reductions in
demand for MAP, under which conditions, and for which populations. We
address these questions with a meta-analysis of the most rigorous
studies aimed at reducing MAP consumption.

The research on diet and its antecedents and consequences is vast. By
our count, there have been at least 120 previous published dietary
reviews in the past two decades, with at least 37 focused specifically
on MAP reduction. However, comparatively few of these are quantitative,
and most prior reviews investigated particular approaches, for example
choice architecture \citep{bianchi2018restructuring} or literacy
interventions \citep{DiGennaro2024}, rather than comparing approaches to
one another. Moreover, two prior investigations revealed three common
gaps in the MAP literature: a dearth of long-term follow-ups, missing
consumption outcomes, and inattention to the gap between intentions and
behavior \citep{mathur2021meta, mathur2021effectiveness}.

Our paper addresses these concerns by meta-analyzing randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) that

\begin{itemize}
\item
  were designed to voluntarily reduce MAP consumption, rather than
  (e.g.) encouraging substitution from red to white meat or fish or
  removing meat from someone's plate
\item
  had least 25 subjects each in treatment and control, or, for
  cluster-randomized trials, at least 10 clusters in total;
\item
  measured MAP consumption, whether self-reported or observed directly,
  rather than (or in addition to) attitudes, intentions, beliefs or
  hypothetical choices;
\item
  recorded outcomes at least a single day after the start of treatment.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, studies needed to be publicly circulated by December 2023
and published in English.

We coded 33 papers
\citep{aldoh2023, allen2002, alblas2023, coker2022, griesoph2021, piester2020, sparkman2017, sparkman2020, andersson2021, kanchanachitra2020, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, cooney2016, feltz2022, haile2021, mathur2021effectiveness, peacock2017, polanco2022, sparkman2021, abrahamse2007, acharya2004, berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, bianchi2022, fehrenbach2015, hatami2018, jalil2023, merrill2009, norris2014, weingarten2022, carfora2023, hennessy2016, mattson2020}
comprising 39 separate studies, 107 interventions, and approximately
90000 subjects. (Some treatments were administered at the level of day
or cafeteria and did not record their number of human subjects.) The
earliest paper was published in 2002 \citep{allen2002}, and a majority
(19 of 33) have been published since 2020.

We also coded a supplementary dataset of 14 papers aimed at reducing,
and measuring, consumption of red and/or processed meat (RPM)
\citep{carfora2017correlational, carfora2017randomised, carfora2019, carfora2019informational, delichatsios2001, dijkstra2022, emmons2005cancer, emmons2005project, jaacks2014, james2015, lee2018, perino2022, schatzkin2000, sorensen2005},
comprising 14 studies, 19 interventions, and approximately 8000
subjects. Last, we compiled a third dataset of over 780 excluded
studies, along with their reason(s) for exclusion.

\end{table}

Studies in our database pursued three theories of change: norms, nudges,
and persuasion, or a combination of norms and persuasion. Table 1
reports the distribution of studies, interventions, subjects
(approximately), and effect sizes per approach.

\textbf{Norms} studies
\citep{aldoh2023, allen2002, alblas2023, coker2022, griesoph2021, piester2020, sparkman2017, sparkman2020}
manipulate the perceived popularity of desired outcomes,
e.g.~plant-based dishes \citep{sparkman2017}. Norms might be descriptive
(``33\% of British people\ldots successfully engaged in one or
more\ldots behaviours to eat less meat'' \citep{aldoh2023}), injunctive
(a message with a frowning face for subjects who eat more meat than the
average person in their country \citep{alblas2023}), or dynamic,
i.e.~they tell subjects that the number of people engaging in desired
behavior is increasing
\citep{aldoh2023, coker2022, sparkman2017, sparkman2020}. The first
norms study meeting our criteria was published in 2017.

\textbf{Nudge} studies \citep{andersson2021, kanchanachitra2020}
manipulate aspects of physical environments to make non-MAP options more
salient, e.g.~placing a vegetarian meal at eye level on a billboard menu
\citep{anderson2021} or placing fish sauce in a bowl with a serving
spoon rather than in a bottle, which makes it serving it more laborious
\citep{kanchanachitra2020}.

\textbf{Persuasion} studies
\citep{kanchanachitra2020, abrahamse2007, acharya2004, berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, bianchi2022, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, carfora2023, cooney2016, fehrenbach2015, feltz2022, haile2021, hatami2018, hennessy2016, mathur2021effectiveness, norris2014, peacock2017, polanco2022, sparkman2021, jalil2023, merrill2009, weingarten2022}
appeal directly to people to eat less MAP. These studies formed the
majority of our database. Arguments typically focus on health the
environment \textemdash usually climate change \textemdash and animal
welfare. Some are designed to be emotionally activating, e.g.~presenting
upsetting footage of factory farms \citep{bertolaso2015}, while others
present facts about, e.g., the relationship between diet and cancer
\citep{hatami2018}. Many persuasion studies combine arguments, e.g.~a
lecture on the health and environmental consequences of eating meat
\citep{jalil2023} or a leaflet with information in all three categories
\citep{hennessy2016}. Table 2 displays the distribution of persuasion
studies within these categories.

Finally, a handful of studies combines \textbf{norms and persuasion}
approaches \citep{hennessy2016, carfora2023, mattson2020, piester2020}.
These interventions typically suggest reasons to eat less meat side by
side with information about changing consumer habits in society.

Three papers \citep{piester2020, hennessy2016, kanchanachitra2020}
evaluate multiple interventions reflecting contrasting theoretical
approaches.

\subsection{An overall small effect}\label{sec2.2}

Our overall meta-analytic effect size is \(\Delta\) = 0.0571 (SE =
0.021), p = .0127. The aggregate effect is statistically significant,
but does not indicate a meaningful reduction.

Figure 1 displays the distribution of effect sizes, grouped by paper,
with each individual point representing an intervention. The overall
effect size is plotted at the bottom.

\includegraphics{results/figures/forest_plot_nulls_and_CIs-1}

This small effect may surprise readers of previous reviews, which
typically found more positive results
\citep{mathur2021meta, meier2022, chang2023}. We attribute this
difference to our stricter inclusion criteria. For instance, of the ten
largest effect sizes recorded in \citep{mathur2021effectiveness}, nine
were non-consumption outcomes and the tenth came from a non-randomized
design. (\citep{bianchi2018conscious} also found effects on intentions
and attitudes but no evidence of effects on behavior.)

According to papers' own analyses, 95 of 107 interventions had null
effects on net MAP consumption. However, many studies present a wide
variety of outcomes, or include MAP reduction as one of many components
of a broader program of behavior change, and focus on their significant
results. Using our calculations of effect size and standard error 13
interventions have 95\% confidence intervals that do not overlap with
zero, 10 of which are positive effects, out of 107 interventions.

\subsection{Moderate evidence of publication bias}\label{sec2.3}

{[}INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ABOUT HOW PUBLICATION BIAS PUTS THE MAIN RESULT
IN ONE LIGHT OR ANOTHER?{]}

We conduct four tests for publication bias.

First, in our dataset, \(\Delta\) and standard error are positively
correlated, though not significantly. {[}GOOD PLACE FOR A FIGURE?{]}

Second, the 9 studies with a pre-analysis plan have a smaller overall
effect: \(\Delta\) = 0.0394 (SE = 0.022), p = .1505. This difference is
not statistically significant.

Third, the The 13 with openly available data also have a smaller overall
effect: \(\Delta\) = 0.0269 (SE = 0.0314), p = .4330. This difference is
also not statistically significant.

Fourth, the pooled effect size of interventions published in
peer-reviewed journals is about 9 times larger than the equivalent
effect size in student theses (table 3). Interventions published by
advocacy organizations produce a small backlash effect on average.

\bottomrule
\multicolumn{4}{l}{\rule{0pt}{1em}* p $<$ 0.05, ** p $<$ 0.01, *** p $<$ 0.001.}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Red and Processed Meat is an easier target}\label{sec2.4}

On average, interventions aimed at reducing consumption of RPM
outperform general MAP reduction interventions: \(\Delta\) = 0.2493
\text{(SE = 0.0707)}, p = .0045. Each of these studies employs
persuasion, and a majority (16/19) appeal to personal health. However,
these studies do not collect data on white meat and/or fish consumption,
and therefore their impact on MAP consumption overall is unknown.

Red meat is of special concern for its environmental and health
consequences \citep{grummon2023}, but eating chicken is arguably worse
for animals on a pound-for-pound basis \citep{mathur2022ethical}. For
some plausible patterns of substitution, these interventions are net
positive for health and the environment and net negative for animal
welfare.

\subsection{Norms work sometimes, but it is not clear why or
when}\label{sec2.5}

The overall effect for intervention with a norms component is \(\Delta\)
= 0.0712 (SE = 0.0537), p = .2125. Of these 23 interventions, 19 are
self-reported nulls. Moreover, the spread of norms results is unusually
large, with a fair number of backlash results
\citep{mattson2020, griesoph2021}, and one paper with four studies, each
featuring real-world settings and objectively measured consumption
outcomes, finding one significant positive result, two nulls, and one
significant backlash \citep{sparkman2020}. We do not see, in this
collection of studies, a clear limiting principle for when norms
interventions achieve their goals.

A forthcoming meta-analysis of dynamic norms interventions concludes
that their overall effects on MAP consumption are negligible
\citep{Weikertova2024}.

\subsection{The evidence for nudges on MAP consumption is
scant}\label{sec2.6}

Although nudges are common in the diet literature writ large
\citep{olafsson2024, cadario2020, szaszi2018}, only two nudge studies
met our inclusion criteria \citep{andersson2021}. Both had moderate
effect sizes on the order of a few percentage points of MAP reduction.
We discuss the nudge literature at length in our appendix.

\subsection{Health studies work better for RPM than for
MAP}\label{sec2.7}

The pooled effect size for persuasion studies with a health component is
\(\Delta\) = 0.0924 (SE = 0.044), p = .0706. This is small and not
significant, albeit larger than the overall pooled effect. Health
appeals are a component of 16 of 19 interventions aimed at reducing RPM
consumption, and are generally more effective there: \(\Delta\) = 0.2554
(SE = 0.0696), p = .0035. Many governmental dietary guidelines {[}e.g.
CANADA and the US{]} encourage consumers to reduce RPM and consume
moderate amounts of lean meat and fish.

We also observe that many health studies either seek to induce a sense
of fear in subjects \citep{berndsen2005} or target people who are at
risk of cancer \citep{hatami2018} or cancer survivors
\citep{james2005, lee2018} with health-based reasons to change their
diets, and then ask them to self-report what they have eaten recently.
We judge self-reporting bias to be a potential concern.

\subsection{Environmental appeals have modest positive
effects}\label{sec2.8}

The pooled effect size for persuasion studies with an environmental
component is \(\Delta\) = 0.0841 (SE = 0.0582), p = .1880. The strongest
evidence that these appeals produce real-world impacts is
\citep{jalil2023}, which substituted an introductory lecture in a
first-year economics class for a lecture on the environment and health
consequences of meat, focusing mostly on the environment, and then
tracked student meal choices in dining halls for three years following.
That study found that treatment led to an overall reduction in MAP
consumption of 5.6\% \(\Delta\) = 0.118 (SE = 0.5717429), which is
neither especially large nor statistically significant. However, due to
its exceptional commitment to long-term, oblique outcome measurement, we
consider this study to be reasonably robust evidence for this
intervention's efficacy among students at liberal arts colleges.

\subsection{Animal welfare appeals are mostly ineffective}\label{sec2.9}

The pooled effect size for persuasion studies with an animal welfare
component is \(\Delta\) = 0.01 (SE = 0.013), p = .4826. A full 59 of 61
interventions in this category are self-described nulls. Slightly more
than half (32 of 61) lead to increases in MAP consumption, though just
one of these effects is statistically significant.

The 52 interventions and 10 studies using materials from advocacy
organizations find an overall effect of -0.0067 (SE = 0.0211), p =
.7656.

These disappointing results conflict with the central conclusions of
\citep{mathur2021effectiveness}, but accord with the finding in
\citep{DiGennaro2024} that animal welfare appeals produce a null effect
on average.

assignment, delivery method}\label{sec2.10}
