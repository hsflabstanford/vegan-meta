\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Demand for meat and animal products (MAP) is increasingly recognized as
a major contributor to premature deaths \citep{willett2019, landry2023},
public health risks \citep{slingenbergh2004, graham2008}, ecological
harms \citep{greger2010} and climate change
\citep{scarborough2023, koneswaran2008} as well as an ethical crisis in
its own right \citep{kuruc2023, singer2023}.

Supply-side interventions, such as banning or taxing certain practices
or products, risk political backlash if public opinion is not
supportive. It is of vital importance, therefore, to assess which
strategies and theoretical perspectives lead to the largest and most
durable reductions in demand for MAP products, under which conditions,
and for which populations. This paper answers these questions with a
meta-analysis of the MAP reduction studies with the strongest designs,
power, and measurement strategies.

The research on diet and its personal, cultural, and practical
antecedents on the one hand and its consequences for health, the
environment, and animal welfare on the other is vast. By our count,
there have been over one hundred previous reviews on these questions in
the past two decades, with at least thirty-seven focused specifically on
MAP reduction. However, two prior investigations revealed three common
gaps in the literature: a lack of long-term follow-ups, a preponderance
of non-consumption outcomes, and inattention to the potential gap
between intentions and what people actually eat
\citep{mathur2021meta, mathur2021effectiveness}. Our paper puts these
issues front and center by exclusively meta-analyzing randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) that meet the following inclusion criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Intention to reduce overall MAP consumption, rather than (e.g.)
  encouraging substitution from beef to chicken
  \citep{mathur2022ethical};
\item
  At least 25 subjects each in treatment and control, or, for
  cluster-randomized trials, at least 10 clusters in total;
\item
  Measures of MAP consumption, whether self-reported or observed
  directly, rather than (or in addition to) attitudes, intentions,
  beliefs or hypothetical choices;
\item
  Outcomes recorded at least a single day after treatment begins.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, studies needed to be made publicly available in English by
December 2023.

In total we, coded 33 papers, comprising 39 separate studies and 107
interventions. \# Results \{\#sec2\}
