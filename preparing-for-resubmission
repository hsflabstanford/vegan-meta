1. Fixed a bunch of typos
2. remember to update the CO capsule (modified vegan-meta.csv, scripts, and the main Rmds)
3. Upload revised manuscript, supplementary materials, and zip file of code and data to OSF

4.  Two duplicates in the excluded studies: 
* Sleboda	2024	Don’t say “vegan” or “plant-based”: Food without meat and dairy is more likely to be chosen when labeled as “healthy” and “sustainable” 
AND  
* Taillie	2022	Developing health and environmental warning messages about red meat: An online experiment.  Will have to adjust PRISMA
*Hielkema 	2022	A “vegetarian curry stew” or just a “curry stew”? – The effect of neutral labeling of vegetarian dishes on food choice among meat-reducers and non-reducers
Update the excluded studies numbers (I added a few more from Chris Bryant as well)
