# Results {#sec2}

# Figures {#sec6}

As per the \LaTeX standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX compilation and `pdf/jpg/png` images for `PDFLaTeX` compilation.
Use the `dev` knitr option to use the appropriate format.
This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX and `PDFLaTeX`.
Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file.
Avoid using subfigures.
The command for inserting images for \LaTeX and `PDFLaTeX` can be generalized.
The package used to insert images in `LaTeX/PDFLaTeX` is the graphicx package.
Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

# Methods {#sec11}

# Discussion {#sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused.
In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable.
It is not mandatory to use both.
Some journals prefer a section 'Results and Discussion' followed by a section 'Conclusion'.
Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

# Conclusion {#sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations.

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable.
It is not mandatory to use both.
Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

# Section title of first appendix {#secA1}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.

For submissions to Nature Portfolio Journals please use the heading "Extended Data".
