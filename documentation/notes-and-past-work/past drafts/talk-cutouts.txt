## A vast literature

Many reasons to cut back on MAP consumption, personally and globally

Big three: animal welfare, health, and the environment

But also plenty others: price, culture, disgust, social pressures

Each of these reasons/strategies is a strand of a truly vast literature

## A vast literature (continued)

We don't know how big, but probably thousands of studies touching on MAP consumption as either independent or dependent variable

There have also been about 40 previous systematic and/or meta-analytic reviews before this one:

## So why write another?

A lot of these papers are focused on assessing some particular approach, e.g. choice architecture or animal welfare appeals

Also, based on past work, we approach this literature with strong priors:

-   Attitudes and intentions don't necessarily predict behaviors

-   Effects decay over time

-   Sample size is inversely proportional to effect size
