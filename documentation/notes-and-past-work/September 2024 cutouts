We coded `r num_papers` such papers [@andersson2021; @kanchanachitra2020; @abrahamse2007; @acharya2004; @banerjee2019; @bianchi2022; @bochmann2017; @bschaden2020; @carfora2023; @hennessy2016; @piester2020; @cooney2014; @cooney2016; @feltz2022; @haile2021; @hatami2018; @jalil2023; @mathur2021effectiveness; @merrill2009; @norris2014; @peacock2017; @polanco2022; @sparkman2021; @weingarten2022; @aldoh2023; @allen2002; @camp2019; @coker2022; @griesoph2021; @sparkman2017; @sparkman2020; @berndsen2005; @bertolaso2015; @fehrenbach2015; @mattson2020; @shreedhar2021] comprising `r num_studies` separate studies, `r num_interventions` interventions, and approximately `r n_total` subjects.
(The N for subjects is a broad approximation because many interventions were administered at the level of day or cafeteria and did not record a precise number of human subjects.) The earliest paper was published in 2002 [@allen2002], and a majority (`r decade_tab$n[3]` of `r num_papers`) have been published since 2020.


We also coded four supplementary datasets.
First is a collection of `r RPMC_papers` papers [@anderson2017; @carfora2017correlational; @carfora2017randomised; @carfora2019; @carfora2019informational; @delichatsios2001talking; @dijkstra2022; @emmons2005cancer; @emmons2005project; @jaacks2014; @james2015; @lee2018; @perino2022; @schatzkin2000; @sorensen2005; @wolstenholme2020] that targeted and measured consumption of red and/or processed meat (RPM), comprising `r RPMC_studies` studies, `r RPMC_interventions` interventions, and approximately `r n_meat_total` subjects.

```{r robust_data, include=F}
source('./scripts/robustness-check.R')
```

Second is a dataset of `r robust_num_papers` papers that we disqualified for methodological reasons but that we include in a supplementary robustness check [@alblas2023; @beresford2006; @dannenberg2023; @delichatsios2001eatsmart; @epperson2021; @frie2022; @garnett2020; @hansen2021; @kaiser2020; @lentz2020; @lindstrom2015; @loy2016; @piazza2022; @reinders2017; @vlaeminck2014].

Third, we coded a dataset of `r excluded_count` papers that we excluded along with their reasons for exclusion.

```{r review_of_reviews}
review_n <- nrow(read.csv('./data/review-of-reviews.csv'))
```

Fourth is a dataset of `r review_n` review papers that we reviewed while searching for papers.

All datasets are provided in our supplementary materials.

Studies in our primary database pursued four theories of change: choice architecture, psychology, persuasion, or a combination of persuasion and psychology.

**Choice Architecture** studies [@andersson2021; @kanchanachitra2020] manipulate aspects of physical environments to reduce MAP consumption. Examples include placing a vegetarian option at eye level on a cafeteria menu [@andersson2021] or making it more laborious for people to serve themselves fish sauce [@kanchanachitra2020].

Do we put in something here about the line between choice architecture and nudge? I currently have it in the results section

**Persuasion** studies [@kanchanachitra2020; @abrahamse2007; @acharya2004; @banerjee2019; @bianchi2022; @bochmann2017; @bschaden2020; @carfora2023; @hennessy2016; @piester2020; @cooney2014; @cooney2016; @feltz2022; @haile2021; @hatami2018; @jalil2023; @mathur2021effectiveness; @merrill2009; @norris2014; @peacock2017; @polanco2022; @sparkman2021; @weingarten2022] appeal directly to people to eat less MAP.
These studies formed the majority of our database.
Arguments focus on health, the environment (usually climate change), and animal welfare.
Some are designed to be emotionally activating, e.g. presenting upsetting footage of factory farms [@polanco2022], while others present information more factually, for instance about the relationship between diet and cancer [@hatami2018].
Many persuasion studies combine arguments, such as a lecture on the health and environmental consequences of eating meat [@jalil2023].

**Psychology** studies [@aldoh2023; @allen2002; @camp2019; @coker2022; @griesoph2021; @piester2020; @sparkman2017; @sparkman2020] manipulate the interpersonal,cognitive, or affective factors associated with eating meat.
The most common psychological intervention is centered on social norms.
These studies seek to alter the perceived popularity of non-MAP dishes [@sparkman2017].
Norms might be descriptive, stating how many people engaged in the desired behavior [@aldoh2023], or dynamic, telling subjects that the number of people reducing their MAP intake is increasing [@aldoh2023; @coker2022; @sparkman2017; @sparkman2020].
Another study looked at response inhibition training, where subjects are trained to associate meat with an inhibiting response [@camp2019].
The first psychology study meeting our inclusion criteria was published in 2017.

Finally, a group of interventions combines **persuasion** approaches with **psychological** appeals to reduce MAP consumption [@berndsen2005; @bertolaso2015; @carfora2023; @fehrenbach2015; @hennessy2016; @mattson2020; @piester2020; @shreedhar2021].

These interventions typically combine persuasive messages with information about changing norms.
Others combine reasons to change one's diet along with an intervention that tests the extended parallel process model (how subjects react to fear [@fehrenbach2015]) or an implementations intentions model [@shreedhar2021] where subjects implement plans for changing their behavior.
