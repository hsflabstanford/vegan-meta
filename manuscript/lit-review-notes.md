### Sparkman 2017 on why meat is bad

" Livestock produce 14.5% to 18% of the total global warming effect, an amount larger than all of transportation (Gerber et al., 2013). Moreover, many people consume far more meat than physicians recommend (Westhoek et al., 2014)."

### the culture context is changing

Sparkman et al 2017 write: "frequent eating is a salient and well-reinforced norm: People eat meat in social and public settings, and default options at most restaurants include meat. Shifting attention to the prescriptive aspect of the norm, one way to remedy a negative descriptive norm (Cialdini et al., 1990), may only remind observers that most people see little wrong with eating meat. Another approach is to correct a shared misrepresentation of the norm. Conveying that many college students drink more than they actually want to can reduce pressure to drink (Schroeder & Prentice, 1998). But with meat consumption, there is often no divergence (to our knowledge) between atti- tudes and behavior—many people just like eating meat. These characteristics of meat eating—its ubiquity, salience, acceptance, and enjoyment—describe many unsustainable behaviors. Yet current theory does not provide clear insight into ways to change them."

but i’d say today we have evidence that this is changing. actually maybe an interesting discussion here about changing norms in general. The alt protein careers speaker talked about how even rural christians and latinos in america notice that they eat too much meat and want to cut back. The culture context is changing. How does this affect the kinds of interventions we want to run? It is still consistent with dynamic norms interventions

# attitudes and intentions don't predict behavior

Do we really need to code attitudes to make this point? We can be pretty sure of it, and others have made it. Wolstenholme 2020: "Intervention studies aimed at reducing meat consumption have begun to emerge in the literature in recent years. These studies have demonstrated that information provision can be effective in encouraging individuals to reduce their meat consumption (e.g., see Bianchi et al., 2018). Although, it should be noted that much of the literature has focused on the effectiveness of interventions on changing attitudes or intentions to eat meat, while fewer studies have demonstrated the effect of informational strategies on eliciting behavior change, i.e., reducing meat consumption (see Harguess et al., 2019). This is problematic as attitudes and intentions do not always predict behavior (Kormos and Gifford, 2014; Hassan et al., 2016), including reducing ones’ meat consumption"

# discuss the fact that we're sometimes observing substitution to vegetarian meals rather than purely vegan (PIester et al 2020).

## do power analyses based on behavioral effects rather than attidudinal or intentional

SParkman 2017 does a power analysis based on results of earlier studies for study 4: "A sample size of 100 participants per condition provides more than 80% power to detect an effect size similar to the small-to-medium-size effects found in Experiments 1 and 2 (ds = 0.31–0.41)." Probably others do this as well (I can double-check). But power analyses should be based on behavioral effects, which tend to be smaller. Based on our literature review, we'd say folks should estimate for sufficiently powered to detect an effect size of about 0.1-0.2. Reference the Econ paper Jeff sent as well in this context.

## Subsection on "dynamic" norms within norms

## additional systematic reviews?

Mention Weikertová meta of dynamic norms

**whether norms are nudges**? Depends on whether they are injunctive or descriptive see Hansen, P. G. (2016). The definition of nudge and libertarian paternalism: Does the hand fit the glove? Brachem 2019 says "Injunctive social norms don’t necessarily qualify as nudges according to Hansen’s (2016) definition, as they work at least partly by changing incentives through the implication of social sanctions." But I think these norm interventions are all pretty descriptive rather than injunctive. Also see [Who can nudge for sustainable development? How nudge source renders dynamic norms (in-)effective in eliciting sustainable behavior](10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133246) Jeff Shrader says "External versus internal constraints is a nice way to think about the distinction."" It looks like the injunctive norm cite is " A focus theory of normative conduct: Recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places"

### publication bias

Look at e.g. Griesoph 2021, in that it does not seem to be a barrier to publication to find nothing. what you do is you talk about heterogeneity and backlash effects and boomerang effects in subgroups **why do nudges fail, by Cass: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2809658>**

**hetereogeneous effect sizes in behavioral science papers** [Behavioural science is unlikely to change the world without a heterogeneity revolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01143-3)

## regarding social norm backlash

Albas 2023: "Moreover, some studies have even observed a so-called boomerang effect, i.e. that social norm interventions lead to undesirable effects (e.g. Clapp et al., 2003; Richter et al., 2018; Wechsler et al., 2003)."

## factors that effect whether nudges work

"[Fluid Intelligence, Attentiveness, Crystallized Intelligence, and Experience](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306281121)...affect the effectiveness of many text-based interventions, producing different observed effect sizes and explaining variations across samples"

### are texts nudges?

the text articles in our dataset don't frame it that way but they're very similar to articles that do we've got the megastudy but also <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2801662> and <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03843-2> and <https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/text_messages_6294f05d-ef00-420d-9a44-24dfc8989d01.pdf>

#### Regression to the meat: the lack of long-term outcome measurement in choice architecture approaches

-   Alter one environment, how do people compensate? Do they? To track this -- to assess general equilibrium effects -- you need to track both what people at and also what they do after they leave the dining hall. No study in our dataset does this Andersson 2021 (and a few others?) address this head on...

#### Social desirability bias..

## are reminders about the environmental consequences of meat nudges?

Dannenberg () says yes b/c people already know about that fact 
We expected (and indeed found) that most participants would already know that a vegan diet would reduce emissions more than a vegetarian diet compared to the average diet containing meat, and that an important part of the information would not be new. Therefore, the information served mainly as a nudge (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008) that reminded participants which choice was the best from a climate perspective. Our treatments show the effect of this information nudge on food choice with and without observation by other people.
