### ok we're doing a bit of a systematic search

### Sparkman 2017 on why meat is bad

" Livestock produce 14.5% to 18% of the total global warming effect, an amount larger than all of transportation (Gerber et al., 2013). Moreover, many people consume far more meat than physicians recommend (Westhoek et al., 2014)."

### the culture context is changing
Sparkman et al 2017 write: "frequent eating is a salient and well-reinforced norm: People eat meat in social and public settings, and default options at most restaurants include meat. Shifting attention to the prescriptive aspect of the norm, one way to remedy a negative descriptive norm (Cialdini et al., 1990), may only remind observers that most people see little wrong with eating meat. Another approach is to correct a shared misrepresentation of the norm. Conveying that many college students drink more than they actually want to can reduce pressure to drink (Schroeder & Prentice, 1998). But with meat consumption, there is often no divergence (to our knowledge) between atti- tudes and behavior—many people just like eating meat. These characteristics of meat eating—its ubiquity, salience, acceptance, and enjoyment—describe many unsustainable behaviors. Yet current theory does not provide clear insight into ways to change them."

but i’d say today we have evidence that this is changing. actually maybe an interesting discussion here about changing norms in general. The alt protein careers speaker talked about how even rural christians and latinos in america notice that they eat too much meat and want to cut back. The culture context is changing. How does this affect the kinds of interventions we want to run? It is still consistent with dynamic norms interventions

# attitudes and intentions don't predict behavior

Do we really need to code attitudes to make this point? We can be pretty sure of it, and others have made it. Wolstenholme	2020: "Intervention studies aimed at reducing meat consumption have begun to emerge in the literature in recent years. These studies have demonstrated that information provision can be effective in encouraging individuals to reduce their meat consumption (e.g., see Bianchi et al., 2018). Although, it should be noted that much of the literature has focused on the effectiveness of interventions on changing attitudes or intentions to eat meat, while fewer studies have demonstrated the effect of informational strategies on eliciting behavior change, i.e., reducing meat consumption (see Harguess et al., 2019). This is problematic as attitudes and intentions do not always predict behavior (Kormos and Gifford, 2014; Hassan et al., 2016), including reducing ones’ meat consumption"
