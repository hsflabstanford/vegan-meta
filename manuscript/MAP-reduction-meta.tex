\abstract{Which theoretical approach leads to the broadest and most
enduring reductions in consumptions of meat and animal products (MAP)?
We address these questions with a theoretical review and meta-analysis
of especially rigorous Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). We
meta-analyze 33 papers comprising 39 studies,107 interventions, and
approximately 90000 subjects. We find that these papers employ either a
nudge, norms, or persuasion approach to changing behavior (some papers
combine norms and persuasion). The pooled effect of these interventions
on MAP consumption outcomes is \(\Delta\) = 0.057, suggesting that we
face an unsolved problem. Reducing consumption of red and processed meat
is an easier target: \(\Delta\) = 0.249, but because of missing data on
potential substitution to other MAP, we can't say anything definitive
about the consequences of these interventions on animal welfare. We
further explore effect size heterogeneity by approach, population, and
study features. We conclude that while no theoretical approach provides
a proven remedy to MAP consumption, designs and measurement strategies
have generally been improving over time, and many promising
interventions await rigorous evaluation.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Consumption of meat and animal products (MAP) is increasingly recognized
as a major contributor to premature deaths
\citep{willett2019, landry2023}, public health risks
\citep{slingenbergh2004, graham2008}, ecological harms
\citep{greger2010} and climate change
\citep{scarborough2023, koneswaran2008} as well as an ethical crisis in
its own right \citep{kuruc2023, singer2023}.

Supply-side interventions, such as banning or taxing certain practices
or products, risk political backlash if they do not have broad public
support. It is of vital importance, therefore, to assess which
strategies and theoretical perspectives lead to consistent reductions in
demand for MAP, under which conditions, and for which populations. We
address these questions with a meta-analysis of the most rigorous
studies aimed at reducing MAP consumption.

The research on diet and its antecedents and consequences is vast. By
our count, there have been at least 120 previous published dietary
reviews in the past two decades, with at least 37 focused specifically
on MAP reduction. However, comparatively few of these are quantitative,
and most prior reviews investigated particular approaches, for example
choice architecture \citep{bianchi2018restructuring}, rather than
comparing approaches to one another. Moreover, two prior investigations
revealed three common gaps in the MAP literature: a dearth of long-term
follow-ups, missing consumption outcomes, and inattention to the gap
between intentions and behavior
\citep{mathur2021meta, mathur2021effectiveness}.

Our paper addresses these concerns by meta-analyzing randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) that

\begin{itemize}
\item
  were designed to voluntarily reduce MAP consumption, rather than
  encouraging substitution from red to white meat or fish or removing
  meat from someone's plate
\item
  had least 25 subjects each in treatment and control, or, for
  cluster-randomized trials, at least 10 clusters in total;
\item
  measured MAP consumption, whether self-reported or observed directly,
  rather than (or in addition to) attitudes, intentions, beliefs or
  hypothetical choices;
\item
  recorded outcomes at least a single day after the start of treatment.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, studies needed to be publicly circulated by December 2023
and published in English.

We coded 33 papers
\citep{aldoh2023, allen2002, alblas2023, coker2022, griesoph2021, piester2020, sparkman2017, sparkman2020, andersson2021, kanchanachitra2020, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, cooney2016, feltz2022, haile2021, mathur2021effectiveness, peacock2017, polanco2022, sparkman2021, abrahamse2007, acharya2004, berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, bianchi2022, fehrenbach2015, hatami2018, jalil2023, merrill2009, norris2014, weingarten2022, carfora2023, hennessy2016, mattson2020}
comprising 39 separate studies, 107 interventions, and approximately
90000 subjects. (Some treatments were administered at the level of day
or cafeteria and did not record their number of human subjects.) The
earliest paper was published in 2002 \citep{allen2002}, and a majority
(19 of 33) have been published since 2020.

We also coded a supplementary dataset of 14 papers aimed at reducing,
and measuring, consumption of red and/or processed meat (RPM)
\citep{carfora2017correlational, carfora2017randomised, carfora2019, carfora2019informational, delichatsios2001, dijkstra2022, emmons2005cancer, emmons2005project, jaacks2014, james2015, lee2018, perino2022, schatzkin2000, sorensen2005},
comprising 14 studies, 19 interventions, and approximately 8000
subjects. Last, we compiled a third dataset of over 780 excluded
studies, along with their reason(s) for exclusion.

\section{Results}\label{sec2}

\subsection{Three theoretical categories: persuasion, choice
architecture, and norms}\label{sec2.1}

Studies in our database pursued three theories of change: norms, nudges,
and persuasion, or a combination of norms and persuasion. Table 1
reports the distribution of studies, interventions, subjects
(approximately), and effect sizes per approach.

\multicolumn{5}{l}{of subjects are rounded estimates.}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Norms} studies
\citep{aldoh2023, allen2002, alblas2023, coker2022, griesoph2021, piester2020, sparkman2017, sparkman2020}
manipulate the perceived popularity of desired outcomes,
e.g.~plant-based dishes \citep{sparkman2017}. Norms might be descriptive
(``33\% of British people\ldots successfully engaged in one or
more\ldots behaviours to eat less meat'' \citep{aldoh2023}), injunctive
(a message with a frowning face for subjects who eat more meat than the
average person in their country \citep{alblas2023}), or dynamic,
i.e.~they tell subjects that the number of people engaging in desired
behavior is increasing
\citep{aldoh2023, coker2022, sparkman2017, sparkman2020}. The first
norms study meeting our criteria was published in 2017.

\textbf{Nudge} studies \citep{andersson2021, kanchanachitra2020}
manipulate aspects of physical environments to make non-MAP options more
salient, such as placing a vegetarian meal at eye level on a billboard
menu \citep{andersson2021} or making it more laborious for people to
serve themselves fish sauce \citep{kanchanachitra2020}.

\textbf{Persuasion} studies
\citep{kanchanachitra2020, abrahamse2007, acharya2004, berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, bianchi2022, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, carfora2023, cooney2016, fehrenbach2015, feltz2022, haile2021, hatami2018, hennessy2016, mathur2021effectiveness, norris2014, peacock2017, polanco2022, sparkman2021, jalil2023, merrill2009, weingarten2022}
appeal directly to people to eat less MAP. These studies formed the
majority of our database. Arguments typically focus on health the
environment \textemdash usually climate change \textemdash and animal
welfare. Some are designed to be emotionally activating, e.g.~presenting
upsetting footage of factory farms \citep{bertolaso2015}, while others
present facts about, e.g., the relationship between diet and cancer
\citep{hatami2018}. Many persuasion studies combine arguments, such as a
lecture on the health and environmental consequences of eating meat
\citep{jalil2023} or a leaflet with information in all three categories
\citep{hennessy2016}.

Table 2 displays the distribution of persuasion studies within these
categories.

\multicolumn{5}{l}{interventions, and subjects will sum to more than the total numbers in the persuasion category.}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Finally, a handful of studies combines \textbf{norms and persuasion}
approaches \citep{hennessy2016, carfora2023, mattson2020, piester2020}.
These interventions typically suggest reasons to eat less meat side by
side with information about changing consumer habits in society.

Three papers \citep{piester2020, hennessy2016, kanchanachitra2020}
evaluate multiple interventions reflecting contrasting theoretical
approaches.

\subsection{An overall small effect}\label{sec2.2}

Our overall meta-analytic effect size is \(\Delta\) = 0.057 (SE =
0.021), p = .0127. The aggregate effect is statistically significant,
but does not indicate a meaningful reduction.

Figure 1 displays the distribution of effect sizes, grouped by paper,
with each individual point representing an intervention. The overall
effect size is plotted at the bottom.

\includegraphics[width=1.2\linewidth,]{./figures/forest_plot-1}

This small effect may surprise readers of previous reviews, which
typically found more positive results
\citep{mathur2021meta, meier2022, mertens2022}. We attribute this
difference to our stricter inclusion criteria. For instance, of the ten
largest effect sizes recorded in \citep{mathur2021effectiveness}, nine
were non-consumption outcomes and the tenth came from a non-randomized
design.

\begin{comment}
([@bianchi2018conscious] also found effects on intentions and attitudes but no evidence of effects on behavior.)
\end{comment}

According to papers' own analyses, 95 of 107 interventions had null
effects on net MAP consumption. However, many studies present a wide
variety of outcomes, or include MAP reduction as one of many components
of a broader program of behavior change, and focus on their significant
results. Using our calculations of effect size and standard error 13
interventions have 95\% confidence intervals that do not overlap with
zero, 10 of which are positive effects, out of 107 interventions.

\subsection{Moderate evidence of publication bias}\label{sec2.3}

We conduct four tests for publication bias.

\begin{comment} 
introductory remarks about how this puts our main results in one light or another? 
\end{comment}

First, in our dataset, \(\Delta\) and standard error are positively
correlated, though not significantly.

\begin{comment} 
good place for a figure?
\end{comment}

Second, the 9 studies with a pre-analysis plan have a marginally smaller
effect: \(\Delta\) = 0.039 (SE = 0.022), p = .1505. This difference is
not statistically significant.

Third, the 13 studies with openly available data also have a marginally
smaller effect: \(\Delta\) = 0.027 (SE = 0.031), p = .4330. This
difference is also not statistically significant.

Fourth, the pooled effect size of interventions published in
peer-reviewed journals is about 9 times larger than the equivalent
effect size in student theses (table 3). Interventions published by
advocacy organizations produce a small backlash effect on average.

Journal article & 54 & 30 & 84900 & 0.0810** (0.0240)\\

\bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\rule{0pt}{1em}* p $<$ 0.05, ** p $<$ 0.01, *** p $<$ 0.001.}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Red and Processed Meat is an easier target}\label{sec2.4}

On average, interventions aimed at reducing consumption of RPM
outperform general MAP reduction interventions: \(\Delta\) = 0.249
\text{(SE = 0.071)}, p = .0045. Each of these studies employs
persuasion, and a majority (16/19) appeal to personal health. However,
these studies do not collect data on white meat and/or fish consumption,
and therefore their impact on MAP consumption overall is unknown.

Red meat is of special concern for its environmental and health
consequences \citep{grummon2023}, but eating chicken is arguably worse
for animals on a pound-for-pound basis \citep{mathur2022ethical}. For
some plausible patterns of substitution, these interventions are net
positive for health and the environment and net negative for animal
welfare.

\subsection{Norms work sometimes, but it is not clear why or
when}\label{sec2.5}

The overall effect for intervention with a norms component is \(\Delta\)
= 0.071 (SE = 0.054), p = .2125. Of these 23 interventions, 19 are
self-reported nulls. Moreover, the spread of norms results is unusually
large, with a fair number of backlash results
\citep{mattson2020, griesoph2021}, and one paper with four studies, each
featuring real-world settings and objectively measured consumption
outcomes, finding one significant positive result, two nulls, and one
significant backlash \citep{sparkman2020}. We do not see, in this
collection of studies, a clear limiting principle for when norms
interventions achieve their goals.

A forthcoming meta-analysis of dynamic norms interventions concludes
that their overall effects on MAP consumption are negligible
\citep{Weikertova2024}.

\subsection{The evidence for nudges on MAP consumption is
scant}\label{sec2.6}

Although nudges are common in the diet literature writ large
\citep{olafsson2024, cadario2020, szaszi2018}, only two nudge studies
met our inclusion criteria \citep{andersson2021}. Both had moderate
effect sizes on the order of a few percentage points of MAP reduction.

\subsection{Health studies work better for RPM than for
MAP}\label{sec2.7}

The pooled effect size for persuasion studies with a health component is
\(\Delta\) = 0.092 (SE = 0.044), p = .0706. This is small and not
significant, albeit larger than the overall pooled effect. Health
appeals are a component of 16 of 19 interventions aimed at reducing RPM
consumption, and are generally more effective there: \(\Delta\) = 0.255
(SE = 0.07), p = .0035. This fits with the broader context where
official nutritional guidelines typically encourage consumers to reduce
RPM and consume moderate amounts of lean meat and fish.

We also observe that many health studies either seek to induce a sense
of fear in subjects \citep{berndsen2005} or target people who are at
risk of cancer \citep{hatami2018} or cancer survivors
\citep{james2015, lee2018} with health-based reasons to change their
diets, and then ask them to self-report what they have eaten recently.
We judge self-reporting bias to be a potential concern.

\subsection{Environmental appeals have modest positive
effects}\label{sec2.8}

The pooled effect size for persuasion studies with an environmental
component is \(\Delta\) = 0.084 (SE = 0.058), p = .1880. The strongest
evidence that these appeals produce real-world impacts is
\citep{jalil2023}, which substituted an introductory lecture in a
first-year economics class for a lecture on the environment and health
consequences of meat, focusing mostly on the environment, and then
tracked student meal choices in dining halls for three years following.
That study found that treatment led to an overall reduction in MAP
consumption of 5.6\% \(\Delta\) = 0.118 (SE = 0.5717429), which is
neither especially large nor statistically significant. However, due to
its exceptional commitment to long-term, oblique outcome measurement, we
consider this study to be reasonably robust evidence for this
intervention's efficacy among students at liberal arts colleges.

\subsection{Animal welfare appeals are almost always
ineffective}\label{sec2.9}

The pooled effect size for persuasion studies with an animal welfare
component is \(\Delta\) = 0.01 (SE = 0.013), p = .4826. A full 59 of 61
interventions in this category are self-described nulls. Slightly more
than half (32 of 61) lead to increases in MAP consumption, though just
one of these effects is statistically significant.

The 52 interventions and 10 studies using materials from advocacy
organizations find an overall effect of -0.007 (SE = 0.021), p = .7656.

\begin{comment}
These disappointing results conflict with the central conclusions of [@mathur2021effectiveness], but accord with the finding in [@DiGennaro2024] that animal welfare appeals produce a null effect on average.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Heterogeneity by reporting, cluster assignment, delivery
method, and country}\label{sec2.10}

Our sample of studies is comparatively small, and many differences
between studies are confounded (for example, 20 of 21 interventions with
objectively reported outcomes are also studies of university
populations). Nevertheless we offer a few tentative explorations of
potential moderators of effect size.

Contrary to our expectations, self-reported and objectively collected
outcomes were not meaningfully different: 0.054 for objectively reported
vs 0.061 for self-reported. Likewise, the difference in effect sizes for
studies where treatment was assigned to clusters (e.g.~cafeteria or day
of treatment) vs.~individuals is small.

Table 4 displays the effect size associated with the four most common
delivery mechanisms in our dataset, which were also the groups with
enough clusters for meta-analysis to be viable.

\begin{table}[!h]

\caption{\label{tab:table_four}Difference in effect size by delivery method}

\end{table}

\section{Methods}\label{sec3}

\textbf{Search}: We employed a multi-pronged search strategy for
assembling our database. First, we checked the bibliographies of three
recent reviews
\citep{mathur2021meta, bianchi2018conscious, bianchi2018restructuring}
for relevant studies. Second, we checked any possibly relevant study
that either cited or was cited by studies we coded. Third, we checked
the bibliographies of authors whose studies we coded. Fourth, we
contacted leading researchers in the field with our in-progress database
to see if we had missed any. Fifth, we rinsed and repeated with the new
studies we had. Sixth, we conducted searched Google Scholar for certain
terms that had come up in studies repeatedly (e.g.~``dynamic norms +
meat'', ``MAP reduction'', and ``plant-based diet + effective''). Sixth,
we checked database emerging from a parallel project being conducted by
Rethink Priorities. Seventh, we identified a further 100+ systematic
reviews and checked their bibliographies, and obtained qualified studies
from six of those reviews
\citep{ammann2023, chang2023, DiGennaro2024, harguess2020, ronto2022, wynes2018}.
Eighth, we used an AI search tool (\url{<https://undermind.ai>}) to
check for gray literature. All three authors contributed to the search.

\textbf{Coding:} For quantitative outcomes, we selected the latest
possible outcome that still had sufficient subjects to meet our
inclusion criteria. Sample sizes were drawn from the same post-test. All
effect sizes were standardized by the standard deviation of the outcome
for the control group at baseline whenever possible (Glass's
\(\Delta\)). All effect size conversions were conducted by the first
author using methods and R code initially developed for previous papers
\citep{paluck2019, paluck2021, porat2024} using standard techniques from
\citep{cooper2019}, with the exception of a difference in proportion
estimator created for \citep{paluck2021} and detailed in the appendix of
\citep{porat2024}.

\textbf{Meta-analysis:} Our initial set of analyses was pre-registered
on the Open Science Framework in November 2023
(\url{<https://osf.io/j5wbp>}), although the project evolved
substantially over time and our final analyses do not match those
initial plans. Our analyses use functions and models from the
\texttt{robumeta} \citep{fisher2015} and \texttt{tidyverse}
\citep{wickham2019} packages in \texttt{R} \citep{Rlang}. Our analysis
uses robust variance estimation methods \citep{hedges2010}.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

We offer three lenses through which to view our results.

First, one might focus on the small effect sizes and the moderate
evidence of publication bias and conclude that what meager effects we do
detect are likely overestimates, and therefore conclude that the true
effect being estimated in this dataset is a null.

Second, one might argue that our assembled database of studies \emph{is}
successfully changing consumption behavior, but in ranges too small for
most studies to detect. By this light, future studies should replicate
existing approaches with sufficient power to detect much smaller
effects.

Moreover, a change of a few percentage points might be significant in
some contexts. For example, if a college calculates that meat
consumption accounts for 20\% of its carbon emissions, a 5.4\% reduction
in meat consumption \citep{jalil2023} achieves a 1\% reduction in carbon
output. Whether or not that is a cost-effective method depends on the
alternatives.

Third, one might look at the largest effect sizes in our dataset, for
instance, the seven interventions with an effect size of
\(\Delta \geq 0.5\)
\citep{bianchi2022, carfora2023, merrill2009, piester2020} and seek to
replicate and/or expand their approaches. However, we'd caution that
these seven interventions are comparatively small, with an average of 95
subjects.

We do not have a clear preference between these interpretations.
However, we are generally encouraged by trends in this literature.

First, as previously noted, a majority of studies that meet our
inclusion criteria have been published in the past few years, suggesting
an overall increase in attention to design and measurement validity.
Second, we applaud researchers in this field for publicizing null
results when they find them. Third, we notice that the universe of
possible interventions and settings is much broader than those we
analyzed, suggesting that some promising approaches await rigorous
evaluation. e.g.~direct contact with animals on an animal sanctuary,
price gradations, high-intensity vegan meal planning, door-to-door
canvassing, or studies taking place in diverse settings such as
retirement homes.

\subsection{Supplementary Methods}\label{supplementary-methods}

\subsubsection{Converting difference in proportions to standardized mean
difference}\label{converting-difference-in-proportions-to-standardized-mean-difference}

Conventional methods of converting binary outcomes to estimates of
standardized mean difference have some notable downsides, e.g.~any given
odds ratio is compatible with multiple possible effect sizes depending
on the rate of occurrence of the dependent variable \citep{gomila2021}.
We address this by treating all binary variables as draws from a
Bernoulli distribution with \(p(1 - p)\), where p is the proportion of
some event's occurrence. For example, if 50\% of the treatment group ate
vegetarian meals vs 45\% for the control group, then Glass's
\(\Delta = \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{0.45 * (1-0.45)}} = 0.1\).

\subsubsection{Four deviations from pre-analysis
plan}\label{four-deviations-from-pre-analysis-plan}

Our pre-analysis plan registered some general principles and hypotheses
for our search process, but did not otherwise do much to constrain how
or where we searched. It also included a synthesized dataset and some
mock analyses that resemble our final analyses in general form. However,
as the project evolved over time, we made four substantive changes to
our paper that we did not anticipate at the pre-analysis stage.

First, we separated studies looking at reductions in red and processed
meat from everything else. Our initial draft took these at face value as
estimates of net MAP reduction. However, we later decided that RPM
reduction was fundamentally a separate estimand, and that without firm
data on substitution to other kinds of MAP, we could not say anything
definite about the net effect on demand for MAP.

Second, and related, we initially included searched for studies that
were not necessarily aimed at achieving overall MAP reduction, but
rather a generally healthier diet with some amount of chicken and/or
fish, for instance the Mediterranean diet. Many of these studies had
measurement strategies that would otherwise have qualified them, i.e
they measured MAP consumption overall or measured consumption in many
categories. However, we ultimately concluded that these were a separate
estimand as well, and we did not want to add noise to the estimate of
studies that were aimed more specifically at reducing MAP consumption
rather than causing inter-MAP substitution.

Third, our initial analyses used the random effects model from
\texttt{metafor} to calculate pooled effect sizes. However, as we
assembled our dataset, we noticed that many papers had, across
interventions, non-independent observations, typically in the form of
multiple treatments compared to a single control group. Upon discussion,
the team's statistician (MBM) suggested that the \texttt{CORR} model
from the \texttt{robumeta} package would be a better fit.

Using our original model from \texttt{metafor}, we detect a pooled
effect size of 0.024 (SE = 0.012), p = .0425. In relative terms, this is
substantially smaller, but in absolute terms, both this model and our
main model produce very small estimates. Table S2 provides an overview
of alternate estimates by our main theoretical approaches.

Fourth, we added many moderators to our dataset that we did not plan on,
such as a broad category for delivery method, whether a study was
intended to be emotionally activating, or whether a program had multiple
components. We did not end up focusing on these in our main paper but
include them in our dataset in case they are of interest.

\subsection{Supplementary Discussion}\label{supplementary-discussion}

\subsubsection{Edge cases for study
inclusion}\label{edge-cases-for-study-inclusion}

Arguably the hardest decision in meta-analysis is what studies to
include or exclude. By far the most common reason was the wrong
dependent variable (e.g.~attitudinal or intentional outcomes). However,
many cases were harder and required some discussion. Here were a few
difficult cases.

Some studies limit dietary portions or switch what people are served
(e.g.~children being served more vegetables at lunchtime). We did not
include these studies because they were essentially guaranteed to have
effects that were either positive or at least bounded at zero. However,
we did include studies that provided free access to meat alternatives
\citep{acharya2004, bianchi2022} and measured outcomes after the
intervention had concluded.

Other studies induce a form of treatment in their control groups, for
instance asked to take a pledge to go vegetarian or encouraged not to
change one's diet over the course of study, which could potentially
induce changes relative to baseline consumption patterns. We only
analyzed studies where with a pure control group or an unrelated
placebo.

Another common design limitation we encountered was treatment assigned
at the level of alternating weeks at a cafeteria. Generally these
studies did not have enough weeks to meet our sample size requirements,
but we also noted that simply alternating weeks is not random assignment
and it is possible that consumption patterns will not be equivalent
between treatment and control groups in expectation.

Last, we encountered many studies that measured fruit and or/vegetable
consumption but not MAP consumption. In some cases, it might have been
possible to make some strong assumptions about substitution and estimate
a MAP effect size, but we decided to focus on studies that reported this
information directly.

\subsubsection{Is a norm a nudge?}\label{is-a-norm-a-nudge}

Tallying how many studies pursue a given theory of change requires
drawing boundaries between those theories. There is some scholarly
debate about whether norms intervention qualify as nudges
\citep{bicchieri2023}. The canonical definition of nudge
\citep{thaler2009} is ``any aspect of the choice architecture that
alters people's behaviour in a predictable way, without forbidding any
options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as
a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid'' (p.~6),
while others \citep{hausman2010} define nudges as ``ways of influencing
choice without limiting the choice set or making alternatives
appreciably more costly in terms of time, trouble, social sanctions, and
so forth'' (p.~126).

By this definition, an injunctive norm intervention, which implies a
threat of social deviance and therefore sanction, clearly does not
qualify. Whether a descriptive norm can be a nudge is trickier. Nudges
are generally designed to address ``flaws in individual
decision-making'' \citep[126]{hausman2010}, while others identify
``unthinking conformity'' as an example of a ``human failing'' that
nudges take as their ``starting point'' \citep[4]{mols2015}.

Our view is that a social norm prompt might engender a rich array of
possible reactions, both cognitive and affective, and we do not assume
that ``unthinking conformity'' is the dominant or exclusive response.
Therefore, we do not classify the norms interventions in our database as
nudges.

A future project might investigate exactly what reactions are occurring
by asking subjects how well they recall a quick norms message and what
it made them think about. A high prevalence of subjects who are unable
to recall the message's specifics but nevertheless reveal treatment
effects would be evidence that norms are acting through automatic rather
than reflective processes.

\subsubsection{A lack of follow-up data in cafeteria-based
interventions}\label{a-lack-of-follow-up-data-in-cafeteria-based-interventions}

One potential source of measurement error that we cannot easily correct
for is the possibility that a subject who is guided towards eating less
meat at one meal eats more at the next, i.e.~``regression to the meat.''
Most cafeteria-based studies we looked at were not designed to measure
this kind of spillover effect. We encourage researchers in this field to
collect follow-up outcomes whenever possible.
