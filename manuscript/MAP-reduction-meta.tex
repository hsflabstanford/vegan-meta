\abstract{Which theoretical approach leads to the broadest and most
enduring reductions in consumptions of meat and animal products (MAP)?
We address these questions with a theoretical review and meta-analysis
of rigorous randomized controlled trials with consumption outcomes. We
meta-analyze 36 papers comprising 42 studies, 114 interventions, and
approximately 88,000 subjects. We find that these papers employ four
major strategies to changing behavior: choice architecture, persuasion,
psychology, and a combination of persuasion and psychology. The pooled
effect of all 114 interventions on MAP consumption is \(\Delta\) =
0.065, indicating an unsolved problem. Reducing consumption of red and
processed meat is an easier target: \(\Delta\) = 0.249, but because of
missing data on potential substitution to other MAP, we can't say
anything definitive about the consequences of these interventions on
animal welfare. We further explore effect size heterogeneity by
approach, population, and study features. We conclude that while no
theoretical approach provides a proven remedy to MAP consumption,
designs and measurement strategies have generally been improving over
time, and many promising interventions await rigorous evaluation.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Reducing global consumption of meat and animal products (MAP) is vital
to reducing chronic disease and the risk of zoonotic pandemics
\citep{willett2019, landry2023, hafez2020}, abating environmental
degradation and climate change
\citep{poore2018, koneswaran2008, greger2010}, and improving animal
welfare \citep{kuruc2023, scherer2019}. However, MAP is widely regarded
as normal, necessary, and a dietary staple
\citep{piazza2022, milford2019}. Global MAP consumption is increasing
annually \citep{godfray2018} and expected to continue doing so
\citep{whitton2021}.

There is a vast and diverse literature investigating potential means to
reverse this trend. Example approaches include providing free access to
meat substitutes \citep{katare2023}, changing the price
\citep{horgen2002} or perceptions \citep{kunst2016} of meat, or
attempting to persuade people to change their diets
\citep{bianchi2018conscious}. A large portion of this literature seeks
to alter the contexts in which MAP is selected
\citep{bianchi2018restructuring}, for instance by changing menu layouts
\citep{bacon2018, gravert2021} or placing vegetarian items more
prominently in dining halls \citep{ginn2024}. Some interventions are
associated with large impacts
\citep{hansen2021, boronowsky2022, reinders2017}, and prior reviews have
concluded that some frequently studied approaches, such as using
persuasive messaging that appeals to animal welfare
\citep{mathur2021meta} or making vegetarian meals the default
\citep{meier2022} may be consistently effective. Governments,
universities, and other institutions are increasingly implementing these
ideas in such settings as dining halls \citep{pollicino2024} and
hospital cafeterias \citep{morgenstern2024}.

However, much of this literature is beset by design and measurement
limitations. Many interventions are either not randomized
\citep{garnett2020} or underpowered \citep{delichatsios2001}. Others
record outcomes that are imperfect proxies MAP consumption, such as
attitudes and intentions \citep{mathur2021effectiveness}, yet behaviors
often do not track with these psychological processes \citep{porat2024}.
Further, many studies measure only immediate impacts
\citep{hansen2021, griesoph2021} rather than longer-term effects, or
focus on hypothetical choices \citep{raghoebar2020, vermeer2010}. Last,
numerous studies that aim to reduce consumption of red and processed
meat (RPM) may induce people to switch to other forms of MAP, such as
chicken or fish \citep{grummon2023}. While RPM is of special concern for
health and greenhouse gas emissions \citep{abete2014, lescinsky2022},
increasing chicken or fish consumption may lead to substantially worse
outcomes for animal welfare \citep{mathur2022ethical}, and fails to
reduce the risk of zoonotic outbreaks from factory farms
\citep{hafez2020} or land and water pollution \citep{grvzinic2023}.

In the past few years, a new wave of MAP reduction research has made
commendable methodological advances in design, outcome measurement
validity, and statistical power. Historically, in some scientific
fields, strong effects detected in early studies with methodological
limitations were ultimately overturned by more rigorous follow-ups
\citep{wykes2008, paluck2019, scheel2021}. Does this phenomenon hold in
the MAP reduction literature as well?

We answer this question with a meta-analysis of rigorously designed RCTs
aimed at creating lasting reductions in MAP consumption
\citep{andersson2021, kanchanachitra2020, abrahamse2007, acharya2004, banerjee2019, bianchi2022, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, carfora2023, cooney2014, cooney2016, feltz2022, haile2021, hatami2018, hennessy2016, jalil2023, mathur2021effectiveness, merrill2009, norris2014, peacock2017, polanco2022, sparkman2021, weingarten2022, piester2020, aldoh2023, allen2002, camp2019, coker2022, sparkman2020, berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, fehrenbach2015, mattson2020, shreedhar2021}.
These RCTs all measured consumption outcomes at least a single day after
treatment was first administered, and all had at least 25 subjects in
both treatment and control, or, in the case of cluster-assigned studies,
at least ten clusters in total. Additionally, we coded a separate
dataset of 17 papers that otherwise met our inclusion criteria but
instead measured changes in consumption of RPM
\citep{anderson2017, carfora2017correlational, carfora2017randomised, carfora2019, carfora2019informational, delichatsios2001talking, dijkstra2022, emmons2005cancer, emmons2005project, jaacks2014, james2015, lee2018, lindstrom2015, perino2022, schatzkin2000, sorensen2005, wolstenholme2020}.

Studies in our meta-analytic database pursued one of four theoretical
approaches: choice architecture (the manipulation of how MAP is
presented to diners), psychological appeals (typically manipulations of
perceived norms around eating meat), explicit persuasion (centered
around animal welfare, the environment, and/or health), or a combination
of psychological and persuasion messages. Interventions varied in
delivery method, for example, documentary films
\citep{mathur2021effectiveness}, leaflets \citep{peacock2017},
university lectures \citep{jalil2023}, op-eds \citep{haile2021}, and
changes to menus in cafeterias \citep{andersson2021} and restaurants
\citep{coker2022, sparkman2021}.

We estimated overall effect sizes as well as effect sizes associated
with different theoretical approaches and delivery mechanisms. Although
we find some heterogeneity across theories and mechanisms, we find
consistently smaller effects on MAP consumption than previous reviews
have suggested
\citep{bianchi2018restructuring, byerly2018, chang2023, harguess2020, kwasny2022, mathur2021meta, meier2022, pandey2023},
with some intriguing exceptions. Thus, contradicting previous reviews
that analyzed a wider array of designs and outcomes, we conclude that
meaningfully reducing MAP consumption is an unsolved problem. However,
many promising approaches still await rigorous evaluation.

\section{Results}\label{sec2}

\subsection{Descriptive overview}\label{descriptive-overview}

Our meta-analysis included 34 papers comprising 40 studies, and 108
separate point estimates, each corresponding to a distinct intervention.
The total sample size was 87,000 subjects (caveat that this is a broad
approximation: many interventions were administered at the level of day
or cafeteria and did not record how many individuals were assigned to
treatment).

The earliest paper was published in 2002 \citep{allen2002}, and a
majority (18 of 34 papers) were published since 2020. Among studies
where treatment was assigned to individuals rather than by clusters, the
median analyzed sample size per study was 131 subjects (25th percentile:
108; 75th percentile: 214).

\subsection{Constituent Theories}\label{constituent-theories}

\textbf{Choice Architecture} studies
\citep{andersson2021, kanchanachitra2020} manipulate aspects of physical
environments to reduce MAP consumption, e.g.~placing vegetarian option
at eye level on a cafeteria menu \citep{andersson2021} or providing
diners with spoons that make it harder for people to serve themselves
fish sauce \citep{kanchanachitra2020}.

\begin{comment}

\end{comment}

\textbf{Persuasion} studies
\citep{kanchanachitra2020, abrahamse2007, acharya2004, banerjee2019, bianchi2022, bochmann2017, bschaden2020, carfora2023, hennessy2016, piester2020, cooney2014, cooney2016, feltz2022, haile2021, hatami2018, jalil2023, mathur2021effectiveness, merrill2009, norris2014, peacock2017, polanco2022, sparkman2021, weingarten2022}
Such messages are often delivered through printed materials, such as
leaflets \citep{haile2021, polanco2022}, booklets \citep{bianchi2022}
articles and op-eds \citep{sparkman2021, feltz2022}, and videos
\citep{sparkman2021, cooney2016, mathur2021effectiveness}. Less common
delivery methods included in-person dietary consultations
\citep{merrill2009}, emails \citep{banerjee2019}, and text messages
\citep{carfora2023}. Arguments focus on health, the environment (usually
climate change), and animal welfare.

\begin{comment}
Some are designed to be emotionally activating, e.g. presenting upsetting footage of factory farms [@polanco2022], while others present information more factually, for instance about the relationship between diet and cancer [@hatami2018].
Many persuasion studies combine arguments, such as a lecture on the health and environmental consequences of eating meat
These studies formed the majority of our database.
\end{comment}

\textbf{Psychology} studies
\citep{aldoh2023, allen2002, camp2019, coker2022, piester2020, sparkman2020}
manipulate the interpersonal,cognitive, or affective factors associated
with eating meat. The most common psychological intervention is centered
on social norms seeking to alter the perceived popularity of non-MAP
dishes \citep{sparkman2020}. In one study, a restaurant put up signs
stating that ``{[}m{]}ore and more {[}retail store name{]} customers are
choosing our veggie options'' \citep{coker2022}. In another, a
university cafeteria put up signs stating that ``{[}i{]}n a taste test
we did at the {[}name of cafe{]}, 95\% of people said that the veggie
burger tasted good or very good! Consider giving the garden fresh veggie
burger a try today!'' \citep{piester2020}. One study told participants
that people who ate meat are more likely to endorse social hierarchy and
embrace human dominance over nature, making meat-eaters out to be a
counter-normative outgroup \citep{allen2002}. Other psychological
interventions include response inhibition training, where subjects are
trained to avoid responding impulsively to stimuli such as unhealthy
food \citep{camp2019}.

\begin{comment}
Norms might be descriptive, stating how many people engaged in the desired behavior [@aldoh2023], or dynamic, telling subjects that the number of people reducing their MAP consumption is increasing over time [@aldoh2023; @coker2022; @sparkman2020].
Another study looked at response inhibition training, where subjects are trained to associate meat with an inhibiting response [@camp2019].
The first psychology study meeting our inclusion criteria was published in 2017.
\end{comment}

Finally, a group of interventions combines \textbf{persuasion}
approaches with \textbf{psychological} appeals to reduce MAP consumption
\citep{berndsen2005, bertolaso2015, carfora2023, fehrenbach2015, hennessy2016, mathur2021effectiveness, mattson2020, piester2020, shreedhar2021}.
These studies typically combine a persuasive message with a norms-based
appeal \citep{piester2020, mattson2020} or an opportunity to pledge to
reduce one's meat consumption
\citep{mathur2021effectiveness, shreedhar2021}.

\subsection{Meta-analytic results}\label{meta-analytic-results}

In our dataset, the pooled effect of all interventions is \(\Delta\) =
0.066 (95\% CI: {[}{[}0.018, 0.114{]}{]}, p = .0094, \(\tau^2\) = 0.006.
We estimate that 24.1\% of true effects are above \(\Delta\) = 0.1, and
just 6.5\% are above \(\Delta\) = 0.2.

Table 1 compares the overall meta-analytic estimate to the subgroup
estimates associated with the four major theoretical approaches, as well
as the three categories of persuasion.

\end{center}

\begin{center}

\end{center}

By contrast, studies that only attempted to reduce consumption of red
and processed meat had larger estimates: across these 17 studies and 25
estimates, we detect a pooled effect of \(\Delta\) = 0.249 (95\% CI:
{[}{[}0.113, 0.385{]}{]}, p = .0016, \(\tau^2\) = 0.04. We estimate that
52\% of true effects are above \(\Delta\) = 0.2.

\subsection{Meta-regression on study characteristics
analysis}\label{meta-regression-on-study-characteristics-analysis}

Table 2 displays average differences in effect size by study population,
region, era of publication, and delivery method.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses}

Table 3 presents average differences by publication status, data
collection strategy, and open science practices.

\begin{center}
[Table 3 about here]
\end{center}

In our dataset, \(\Delta\) and standard error are positively correlated
(r = 0.127), though not significantly (p = .1886). See supplementary
materials for further sensitivity checks. {[}which statistical checks do
we want to do?{]}

\section{Methods}\label{sec3}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

Our sample of studies is comparatively small\ldots Meta-regression
estimates correlations of study characteristics with effect size, and
thus does not necessarily indicate which study characteristics cause
interventions to work better. Also, study characteristics were often
highly correlated, limiting our ability to detect their independent
associations with effect size. For example, 17 of 18 interventions with
objectively reported outcomes are also studies of university
populations.
