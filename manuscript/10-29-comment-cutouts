Most interventions are brief and light-touch, e.g. reading a leaflet [@cooney2014] or watching a short video [@mathur2021effectiveness]. Venues with more than one publication from the dataset were \textit{Appetite}, \textit{Journal of Environmental Psychology}, and \textit{Nutrients}.

Some are designed to be emotionally activating, e.g. presenting upsetting footage of factory farms [@polanco2022], while others present information more factually, for instance about the relationship between diet and cancer [@hatami2018].
Many persuasion studies combine arguments, such as a lecture on the health and environmental consequences of eating meat
These studies formed the majority of our database.

Norms might be descriptive, stating how many people engaged in the desired behavior [@aldoh2023], or dynamic, telling subjects that the number of people reducing their MAP consumption is increasing over time [@aldoh2023; @coker2022; @sparkman2020].
Another study looked at response inhibition training, where subjects are trained to associate meat with an inhibiting response [@camp2019].
The first psychology study meeting our inclusion criteria was published in 2017.

In results:
Meta-analyzing the MAP and RPM studies combined yields an overall estimate of SMD = `r round(merged_model$reg_table$b.r, 3)` (95% CI: `r merged_results$CI`), p = `r merged_results$p_val`, $\tau$ = `r merged_results$tau`.
