  This paper meta-analyzes interventions intended to reduce consumption of meat and animal products (MAP), focusing on the most rigorous, policy-relevant studies. Extant efforts generally embody one of two theoretical perspectives: information-based approaches that attempt to change attitudes towards MAP consumption, and place-based interventions that make MAP less salient, appealing, or affordable in a particular context. We find that direct appeals to the environment and personal health, along with some changes to layouts and messages in university cafeterias, can reduce MAP consumption, while appeals to animal welfare, online studies, and leafletting studies have no apparent overall effect.  However, even the very best studies in this literature typically have concerning measurement limitations: for information-based approaches, the predominance of self-reported outcomes, and for place-based approaches, a lack of post-intervention follow-up. In other words, information-based approaches are at risk of social desirability bias, and place-based approaches are at risk of "regression to the meat:" the possibility that someone who is nudged into eating less MAP at one meal will compensate by eating more at the next. Our meta-analysis paper proffers some statistical approaches to addressing these biases, producing a wide range of point estimates. We also highlight the findings of the studies whose designs and measurement strategies convincingly address both issues. We conclude with concrete, shovel-ready suggestions for future researchers that take the lessons of this analysis into account.

## 1. Introduction: a multitude of perspectives on changing dietary behavior

Reducing consumption of meat and animal products (MAP) is vital to many policy goals. Animal agriculture is a major driver of climate change [@scarborough2023; @koneswaran2008; @goodland2009] as well as more localized environmental and public health harms [@horrigan2002; @slingenbergh2004; @graham2008; @greger2010]. Excess MAP consumption is a leading cause of premature deaths [@willett2019; @landry2023]; finally, the conditions in which farmed animals live and die are increasingly recognized as a policy matter in their own right [@yeates2011; @webster2001; @kuruc2023].

Policymakers have a broad array of tools at their disposal for attempting to change eating behavior. For example, they can ban certain kinds of food [@caro2009] or practices [@bursey2018] perceived to be unusually cruel; campaign for vegetarianism [@trewern2022]; or change eating environemnts to make non-meat options more salient or appealing [@guthrie2015; @bianchi2018restructuring]. However, any policy lever which focuses on supply rather than reducing consumer demand risks backsliding through political correction [@michielsen2022]. It is essential, therefore, to assess which theoretical approaches most effectively and durably alter consumer eating behavior. This paper approaches that question with a theoretically comprehensive review and methodologically focused meta-analysis. 

A previous review called on future MAP research to feature more “direct behavioral outcomes” and “long-term follow-up" [@mathur2021meta, p. 1]. Our paper shares those commitments, and thus restricts its meta-analysis to the very most rigorous, policy-relevant research: randomized controlled trials with at least 25 subjects in treatment and control (or at least 10 clusters in cluster-assigned studies) that measure actual MAP consumption at least a single day after treatment begins.^[We also required that the full papers be available on the internet, rather than just a summary or abstract, and written in English.] We identified 42 such interventions published in 28 papers or technical reports. 

As an academic subject, reducing MAP consumption has no clear disciplinary home. Scholars have consequently approached the problem form many theoretical approaches, including social psychology [@rosenfeld2018], economics [@lusk2009], choice architecture [@bianchi2018restructuring; @mertens2022]; and environmental studies [@costello2016]. The central theoretical divide in the literature's most rigorous, policy-relevant evaluations is between **information-based approaches** that attempt to change ideas about MAP consumption in general, and **place-based interventions** that make MAP consumption more difficult, expensive, or apparently counter-normative in a restaurant or university dining hall. The question of comparative efficacy between these two approaches \textemdash put crudely, information vs. manipulation \textemdash is of interest to behavioral scientists and policymakers across a broad array of outcomes.

Our main quantitative finding is that appeals to personal health and the environment are the most broadly effective MAP reduction strategies. We also see some evidence of change resulting from price- and salience-based changes to some university dining halls, and text-based reminders of prior intentions to reduce MAP consumption. We find overall null results for appeals to animal welfare, studies conducted online, and leafletting studies. 

However, we place low confidence in the generalizability of these results due to two serious concerns about measurement bias. The first is social desirability bias arising from self-reported outcomes [@mathur2021effectiveness], which are predominant in the information-based literature. The second is a lack of engagement with the possibility of compensatory/backlash effects in the place-based literature: that someone who is nudged into eating less MAP at one meal may perceive a moral license [@merritt2010; @blanken2015] to eat more MAP later. If we limit our analysis to studies with measurement strategies that accommodate both potential threats to inference, we still conclude that appeals to the environment and health concerns reduce MAP consumption, but in the highly specialized context of dining halls at an elite liberal arts college. For this literature to truly become shovel-ready for policymakers, extension and replication, along with careful attention to measurement bias, are essential next steps.

Our paper builds on two literatures. The first is systematic reviews of attempts to reduce MAP consumption, of which there have been 22 by our count, with two others that we know of forthcoming. (See appendix A for a complete overview). Our paper makes four contributions on top of this already rich set. First, our database is current as of December 2023, which has significance in an emerging literature whose most credible estimates and best designs tend to be in recent publications. Second, our review is quantitative, while most previous reviews are narrative or systematic reviews but do not offer meta-analysis. Third, among papers with a meta-analytic component, ours is (so far) unique for being theoretically comprehensive rather than focusing on the effects of a single conceptual approach. Fourth, ours is the only review to our knowledge to set strict inclusion criteria that attempt to identify the most rigorous, policy-relevant research.

Second, our paper contributes to a growing literature of meta-analyses, reviews, and "megastudies" [@doella2023; @milkman2021] that attempt to compare the efficacy of different approaches to solving social problems. In social psychology, @paluck2021 and @porat2024 apply meta-analytic methods to testing the efficacy of different theories to reducing prejudice and sexual violence, respectively, while @vlasceanu2024 test 11 theoretically diverse interventions aimed at four "climate mitigation outcomes" (p. 1).^[This is distinct from the "Metaketa" initiatives from Evidence on Governance and Politics, which run many field experiments simultaneously to test the effect of one theoretical approach on a common outcome [@slough2021; @blair2021]. Metaketas are concerned primarily with external validity, while megastudies are aimed at the comparative efficacy of interventions.] In a related vein, @bergquist2023 provide a meta-analysis of meta-analyses for climate mitigation behaviors, finding that social comparison and financial incentives were generally effective, while information and feedback generally were not. We also build prior reviews that that holistically assess the efficacy of choice architecture approaches versus, e.g., taxes [@list2023] or subsidies [@campos2021]. Finally, a paper from @bergman2024 compares information-based approaches to "short-term financial assistance, customized assistance during the housing search process, and connections to landlords" (p. XXX) to encourage families to move to high-opportunity areas. Our paper's approach is similar to all of these but distinct, to the best of our knowledge, for the stringency and policy focus of our meta-analytic inclusion criteria.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 details (and motivates) the inclusion criteria and search process by which we assembled our meta-analytic database. Section 3 describes the database. We provide some descriptive statistics about the database, and then present its six major theoretical approaches \textemdash environmental, health, and animal welfare appeals to MAP reduction comprising information-based strategies, and norms manipulations, choice architecture, and incentive approaches comprising place-based strategies \textemdash and representative literature from each. For each subset, we also highlight some frequent design or measurement limitations that led us to exclude otherwise promising results. Section 4 provides an overview of our meta-analytic methods and procedures. 

Section 5 presents our quantitative results. We provide a mixture of pooled averages, tests for publication biases, and comparisons of different approaches. We also offer some attempts to estimate the magnitude of different biases in this literature drawn from related literatures, and to use those estimates to offer effect size corrections. These analyses are tentative, and offer readers a broad range of possibilities intended to match different priors about the severity and importance of the measurement issues we enumerate Section 6 concludes with some concrete suggestsion for future MAP reduction researchers based on the results of our analyses.
