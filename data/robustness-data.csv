We can take the effect of treatment on the particular stations as a given and that's perhaps a biased estimate of the effect overall. The authors present an uncertainty bound where we assume that the decline in meals chosen on default days is entirely driven by people who go elsewhere and then choose meat., and then we get an effect of a relative reduction of  21.6%. But that's a lot of guesswork. A reader might find this problem less of a concern and take their estimate at face value, and if so, it's a very promsing result."
