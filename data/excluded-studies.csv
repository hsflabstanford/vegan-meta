The largest portion made up 48% of the units sold. Thus, slightly more than half of the customers (52%) bought a smaller portion (small or medium) than they would have bought in a single choice architecture, such that 100% proportion of default portion size units sold in the preceding month was significantly higher than the proportion units sold during the intervention (48%), z =10.3, p < 0.001). Comparing the default choice architecture versus additional portions, while assuming an equal number of units sold regardless of the setting, we note that 13% less meat (in kg) would have been sold, due to the purchases of smaller portions.""
