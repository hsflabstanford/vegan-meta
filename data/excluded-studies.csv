Interesting study. there's a second treatment condition we didn't include because of post-treatment non-randomness. Some people in the injunctive norm get a frowny face if they are eating above average meat and a smiley face if they are doing better than average. But that's based on baseline covariate data gathered in the data collection process, so effectively there are *two* treatments, one with a positive mersage and one with a negative, but the negative or positive message isn't randomly assigned. Final note: the overall effect size for that condition was 0.01."
