It is doing a pretty intrusive nudge in conjunction with health advice but in its own words it is doing theory of planned behaviorI suppose there is an argument for excluding this on the basis that we want to show *lasting* effects i.e. those that endure beyond treatment itself. But we included studies like this in the contact and prejudice metas and it does at least show that text messages produce more than a momentary effect,

Also, it's borderline excludable because its methods aren't replicable -- the specific changes to the microenvironment “were not reported in detail, precluding more detailed analyses of this intervention."" Alas. Noting here that it's stratified random assignment rather than cluster. Finally, this study reports costs for cost-effective estimates",
