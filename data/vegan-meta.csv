Allen,2002,Manipulating the symbolic meaning of meat to encourage greater acceptance of fruits and vegetables and less proclivity for red and white meat,10.1006/appe.2001.0474,Harguess,salience condition,Being told of a scientific study that people who endorse social hierarchy and who embrace human dominance over nature are more likely to eat meat,red and white meat consumption,N,39,58,unspecified_null,0.01,NA,0,21,psychology,NA,Y,Australia,adults,"finds that people who reject hierarchy and dominance in the treatment group reduce their meat consumption but red and white meat consumption between the groups overall ""remained constant"" despite a rise in the fruits and veggies consumption rising in the treatment group. This is what the authors report. However table 4 tells us that actually the treatment group saw a meaningful reduction in red and white meat consumption and also highly differential treatment by treatment condition with Ns they don't report elsewhere. On the other hand, table 3 reports a tiny reduction in average servings per week that doesn't correspond to that result at all. The data analysis in this paper is a mess and the outcome is very crude (self-reported ""increaesd fruits and veggies consumption in the last week?""). We could theoretically take table 4 as the canonical result but I think it makes more sense to just call this an unspecified null. If the authors had provided a SD of meat consumption in table 3 we'd be somewhere but lacking that I don't think we should take the authors at face value when they say that there was no effect."

It's also very tempting to code this as an unspecified null because the effects 7 days later are totally null and there's a bit of a spike in vegetarianism and then a moderate backlash. but instead I'm taking them at face value when they say that the WLS and AIPW estimators overall show an effect of about 6%, which I'm assuming is cumulative. This also corresponds to the abstract, where they say there was a decline of ""6 to 9 percentage points in university canteens"" of meat eating. I'm not seeing any estimators in the 9% range but whatever. I think 6% is a reasonable point estimate for a study that provides a *lot* of different estimators (it's also effectievely the DiD estimate b/c apparently there were baseline differnces in meat consumption)"

What we really want is proportion of vegetarian meals ordered on the treatment days minus proportion of vegetarian meals ordered on control days without covariates and we want both data points reported. Instead we have z scores which are beta / se and theoretically se = sd / sqrt(n) assuming no covariates (which there are) so hypothetically we can convert z to via z/sqrt(n). However before we publish for real let's see if we can get to the bottom of this.
