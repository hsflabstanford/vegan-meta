This is what the authors report. However table 4 tells us that actually the treatment group saw a meaningful reduction in red and white meat consumption and also highly differential treatment by treatment condition with Ns they don't report elsewhere. On the other hand, table 3 reports a tiny reduction in average servings per week that doesn't correspond to that result at all. The data analysis in this paper is a mess and the outcome is very crude (self-reported ""increaesd fruits and veggies consumption in the last week?""). We could theoretically take table 4 as the canonical result but I think it makes more sense to just call this an unspecified null. If the authors had provided a SD of meat consumption in table 3 we'd be somewhere but lacking that I think we should take the authors at face value when they say that there was no effect.",

First, it looks like a big result *but only if you ignore fish.* What's actually happening is that meat declines by 4 percentage points on control days, but only 1 percent of that is substitution towards vegetarian meals; the remaining 3 percentage points of that is towards fish, which is MAP. That's not nothing, but it's against a baseline percentage of So the effect size is 0.01, whichis not *nothing* but it's also not going to be significant. Second, what I'm calling regression to the meat they call ""behavioral spillovers"" and they addres it directly: ""Behavioral spillovers can be both positive (adding to the effect) and negative (offsetting the effect). Thus, the claimed, although not perfectly evident, effect of the nudge, that individuals on average choose a more sustainable option for lunch and thereby reduce the effect on the climate, might be offset by behavioral spillover effects being present. Unfortunately, we cannot address these important questions with the data available in this study. This calls for further research."" Third,  ""Unfortunately, the data does not allow us to track the purchases of one person across days."" Fourth, nice evidence of how it's just really hard to run these kinds of experiments: ""The meat option was always displayed at the top of the menu on the website for the first part of the period, both for the daily and weekly menus. It was noted as the experiment went on that as from 1 April, six weeks into the schedule of randomization, the vegetarian option was placed at the top of the menu online""",

Having said that, that's what the authros provide and it does provide pretty solid evidence against a lot of theories.

I'm not seeing much in the way of baseline or population standards for proportion of vegetarian meals on a control day. What we really want is proportion of vegetarian meals ordered on the treatment days minus proportion of vegetarian meals ordered on control days without covariates and we want both data points reported. Instead we have z scores which are beta / se and theoretically se = sd / sqrt(n) assuming no covariates (which there are) so hypothetically we can convert z to via z/sqrt(n). However before we publish for real let's see if we can get to the bottom of this. ,
