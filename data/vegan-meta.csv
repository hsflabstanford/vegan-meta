The Ns are a little conflusing because the paper varies between households (asdsigned)) and people actuallly doing the thing (in table 3 where outcomes are recorded). The paper also says that he average household is 2.5 people so the n_total numbers are from that. Last, there is a tricky problem here in capturing precvision with two interventions and one control group, and only one effet size presetnted for both groups. The way to count the number of interventions in the dataset accurately is to report two effect sizes (both the same thing because then at least the average is correct and we have no basis for marking them otherwise because of the combined effect size). However this has the effect of making effectively doubling the size of the control group. Does robumeta deal with this? ",

This is what the authors report. However table 4 tells us that actually the treatment group saw a meaningful reduction in red meat but not in white meat, with Ns they don't report elsewhere. (Perhaps different numbers of respondents answered different numbers of questions?) On the other hand, table 3 reports a tiny reduction in average servings per week that doesn't correspond to that result at all. The data analysis in this paper is a mess and the outcome is very crude. We could theoretically take table 4 as the canonical result but I think it makes more sense to just call this an unspecified null. If the authors had provided a SD of meat consumption in table 3 we'd be somewhere but lacking that I think we should take the authors at face value when they say that there was no effect. Also, 110 participants returned the follow-up surveys (p. 121), so the Ns should probably equal that, but their are different Ns reported all throughout the paper. So I just went with 55 and 55. That's approximately correct I suppose",

First, it looks like a big result *but only if you ignore fish.* What's actually happening is that meat declines by 4 percentage points on control days, but only 1 percent of that is substitution towards vegetarian meals; the remaining 3 percentage points of that is towards fish, which is MAP. That's not nothing, but it's against a baseline percentage of So the effect size is 0.01, which, again is not *nothing* but it's also not going to be significant. Second, what I'm calling regression to the meat"" they call ""behavioral spillovers"" and they addres it directly: ""Behavioral spillovers can be both positive (adding to the effect) and negative (offsetting the effect). Thus, the claimed, although not perfectly evident, effect of the nudge, that individuals on average choose a more sustainable option for lunch and thereby reduce the effect on the climate, might be offset by behavioral spillover effects being present. Unfortunately, we cannot address these important questions with the data available in this study. This calls for further research."" Third,  ""Unfortunately, the data does not allow us to track the purchases of one person across days."" Fourth, nice evidence of how it's just really hard to run these kinds of experiments: ""The meat option was always displayed at the top of the menu on the website for the first part of the period, both for the daily and weekly menus. It was noted as the experiment went on that as from 1 April, six weeks into the schedule of randomization, the vegetarian option was placed at the top of the menu online."" Fifth, in terms of total_ns, I am multiplying the average number of meals sold * the number of days, which is a simplifying assumption (that no one shows up more than once). I'm confident some people did however. This is a hard one .",

That's completely fine, it's just that the study is aiming at reducing salt intake per person and what we're interested in is not quite that. Second, I excluded the condition with the information: "" “Do not add more than 2/3 teaspoons of fish sauce per meal”. Maybe some people took this as mandatory -- I think I would have and thus we're not getting any effect of voluntary reduction but something closer to just taking fish sauce away. Third, Ns are a bit of guesswork, they tell us number of meals sold in each condition per canteen and then I multiply that by 0.9 to accomodate some amount of repeat visiting per canteen. There is probably crossover between conditions per week in any case. Fourth, I redid the significance calculations b/c of the difference in variable we vs. the study's authors are interested in.",

I ended up redoing the stats from scratch based on the data and a conversation with Jacob. Basically I filtered out all groups where N < 25 and there's no data on the Total_Chg variable (which is the d_i_d var). Now arguably we could try to figure something out with just the endline data and get larger Ns but there's a tradeoff there for one kind of precision vs. another and it's a lot more straightforward to limit the analysis to folks who have Total_Chg scores reported",

Instead we have z scores which are beta / se and theoretically se = sd / sqrt(n) assuming no covariates (which there are) so hypothetically we can convert z to via z/sqrt(n).
